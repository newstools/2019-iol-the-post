“The man was dressed in a security guard’s uniform. When the woman realised that the child had been taken, she rushed to alert mall security. She spotted the man walking into a shop,” he said. Naicker said the woman grabbed the child from the man’s arms and told mall management what had happened. “Police officers from the Durban North police station arrived at the scene and viewed the CCTV footage at the mall. The suspect was immediately identified as a security guard who was on duty at the mall and he was arrested," Naicker said. As part of of his bail conditions, Bulose is not allowed back at the shopping centre. He is also not allowed to speak to any of the witnesses. Bulose has been suspended from work and will have to report to the Ntuzuma Police Station once a week. The incident has moved police to warn parents to be vigilant when they are out with their children, especially in busy areas during the festive season. The Mercury
