Durban - A 35-year-old KwaZulu-Natal woman has undergone the first of many surgical procedures to restore feeling in her right hand after her partner hacked both her arms during a domestic dispute earlier this week. Happiness Nxumalo recalled how her partner took a bushknife and attacked her in front of her two-year-old daughter on Tuesday before taking his own life. Nxumalo said her boyfriend began fighting with her on Monday night. "On Tuesday, he took a big knife, a bush knife, and cut both my hands. He hit me all over my body and my head. I was hurt very bad and there was a lot of blood all over the room. My two-year-old was crying and I was crying," she said. Nxumalo, a teacher, said the man then took a rope and committed suicide. She said she ran to call her neighbours who alerted an ambulance service. Nxumalo was rushed to a local clinic and thereafter airlifted to the Netcare St Augustine's hospital where she is due to undergo a series of operations and medical interventions in order to restore feeling in her right hand.
