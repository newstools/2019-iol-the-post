Durban - An Indian filmmaker has caused a stir on social media after stating that rape should be legalised. According to the Daily Mail UK, Daniel Shravan further said women should cooperate during sex attacks by carrying condoms and slammed the Indian government for frightening rapists. In a series of now deleted posts, Shravan, said rape was not a serious thing but that murder was inexcusable. He stated that government should legalise rape without violence for the safety of women.     Shravan's comments were made following the rape of 27-year-old Priyanka Reddy whose charred body was found under an overpass in Hyderabad in India last week. The attack spurred Indian MP, Jaya Bachchan, to call for Reddy's attackers to be lynched in public. Reddy, a vet, was raped and murdered by a group of men who offered to help her with a punctured tyre. Four men have since been arrested for the attack. Shravan said women should accept men's sex. His comments have been slammed by the official #MeTooIndia Twitter account.     Many took to social media to condemn the filmmaker's comments.             The Mercury
