Durban - There were smiles on the faces of the residents of Graaff Reinet who received much-needed water on Tuesday. Relief organisation Gift Of the Givers arrived with three trucks laden with water and three water tankers just before noon. Hundreds of residents waited in line, eager to collect their water. According to Director of the organisation, Imtiaz Sooliman the town was "on its knees" with regards to having access to drinking usable water because the Nqweba Dam in Graaff Reinet is empty. He said desperate residents were collecting water from unhygienic drains and children were pushed away from water tankers as residents "fight" for the little water that arrives.
