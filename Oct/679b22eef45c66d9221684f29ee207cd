 Her husband Navin Chanderlal, 53, was arrested and charged with her murder. During his bail application, he said he could not recall the day of the incident as he was on medication and was battling severe depression. He said after taking his medication he would sleep for days. Chanderlal, who is represented by attorney Chris Gounden, was released on bail of R3000.  On Thursday, the indictments, presented by State advocate Krishan Shah, were served on Chanderlal in the Chatsworth Magistrate’s Court. In a summary of the facts, the State alleged that Pillay grew apart from Chanderlal, and that the mother of two was intent on divorcing him and moving abroad to reside with her children. “The accused was unhappy about this, and decided to kill the deceased. “On December 24, 2018, and in circumstances unknown to the State, he killed the deceased and left her body in the bathroom of their home.” A post-mortem revealed that the cause of death was a suspected compression of the neck, according to the court papers. At least 27 witnesses are expected to testify at the trial. Chanderlal’s bail was extended until his next court appearance. POST
