The trial was set to begin in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court on Friday. Natasha Ramkissoon-Kara, the spokesperson for the National Prosecuting Authority, said the State requested an adjournment but was denied a further remand due to the absence of a chief witness. Kevin Periasamy, his wife, Desiree, and his brother, Kalvin Periasamy, along with Jason Alexander, Shaun Mawesa, Justin Williams, and Vuyani Nyawose were arrested last January following a joint operation between various specialised police units including the Hawks. They faced more than 30 charges, including drug dealing, crimen injuria, robbery, intimidation, kidnapping, and assault. Police said they recovered R97156 in cash, two pistols, a shotgun, 64 live rounds of ammunition, 1836 heroin caps, 138 heroin straws, 80 large crack cocaine pieces, 30 mandrax tablets, three bags of cocaine, two ecstasy pills, and 186 grams of dagga during the raid. Kalvin was gunned down at an uMhlanga parking lot earlier this year. His widow, Jearldine, said she was relieved the case was provisionally withdrawn. “All these stories going around about our family are false and this is a well-known fact. My husband lost his life because of all this commotion and now that it is over, I want peace in my life. I don’t need anymore commotion.” The investigation into Kalvin’s death is ongoing. POST
