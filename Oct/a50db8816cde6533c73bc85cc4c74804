Durban -  A Phoenix pensioner who was severely beaten and tied up during a house robbery on Thursday died in hospital over the weekend. The 67-year-old man was found lying on the floor in his Rydalvale home moments after the brutal attack. His hands and feet were tied up with an extension cord. The victim had sustained a cut to the mouth, cuts to both his ankles, a broken rib and injuries to the left side of his body. Gareth Naidoo, a spokesperson for KZN VIP Security, said they were called to the scene after neighbours heard faint screams coming from the victim's home. "When our team arrived at the scene we were unable to gain entry into the home. Reaction officers could hear the pensioner calling for help once again. The door was then broken down for response teams to enter the home and assist the pensioner." Naidoo said the entire house had been ransacked. "The pensioner was found in the room. He was tied up and severely beaten. We stabilised the victim before taking him to hospital." The victim, however, succumbed to his injuries on Saturday. Police had not responded to request for comment at the time of publishing. POST
