Durban - A Durban man who is hired to spin his car tyres at funerals and events throughout the province has been convicted of reckless and negligent driving. The man appeared in the Chatsworth Magistrate's Court on Thursday and was fined R3000. Warren Pretorius, 25, handed himself over to Bayview SAPS this week after a video surfaced of him spinning the tyres of his green BMW outside the Mobeni Heights Cemetery in Chatsworth. Metro police spokesperson Parbhoo Sewpersadh confirmed that Pretorius' BMW had been recovered in Newlands East and was impounded by Durban Metro police. Sewpersadh said they would not "tolerate this kind of behaviour on public roads and in public places." "We urge the community to bring this sort of behaviour to our attention immediately," said Sewpersadh. The Daily News reported that the police were also probing the alleged involvement of a security firm, a private ambulance service and a funeral service in reported traffic infringements and firing of guns during the funeral procession.
