Durban - Umbilo SAPS are investigating two counts of murder after the bodies of two men were found in a park in Umbilo in Durban this week. KZN police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, said the victims were believed to be in their 20s and sustained stab wounds and showed signs of being assaulted. Zwane said their bodies were discovered by a passer-by at around 11am on Wednesday. He said the victims had not been identified as yet. Zwane said anyone with information should contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111. Earlier this month, the body of a 22-year-old South Coast woman was found in a shallow grave. Police said the woman was last seen going to visit friends on September 11, and when she did not arrive they decided to contact the police. A 25-year-old man has been charged for both her murder and rape and has appeared in the Ramsgate Magistrate's Court. POST
