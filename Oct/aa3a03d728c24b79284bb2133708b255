Mohammad Uzair Khan, 37, who ran a commercial truck and rim repair shop in Clairwood, was shot through the arm and the bullet entered his chest. He died at the Netcare Kingsway Hospital. Aidan David, the chairperson of the Isipingo Community Police Forum, said Khan, who lived in Marlin Street, was accosted by an armed suspect. “He was still in his VW Golf when the suspect and his accomplices attempted to hijack him. We believe Mohammad did not want to give up the vehicle and he was shot.” David said the emergency services took Khan to the hospital but he succumbed to his injury. He said it was difficult to apprehend suspects in the area because there were many entry and exit points. Khan’s uncle, Goolam, said: “Our family is devastated. Mohammad had an 11-year-old son, who now has to grow up without a father. Crime in South Africa seems to be going from bad to worse.” Khan was buried at the Flower Road Cemetery in Clairwood. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of murder was being investigated and no arrests were made. POST
