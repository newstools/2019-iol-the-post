In the crossfire, five bullets struck a shopper’s white Polo who had entered the parking lot. The driver of the Polo, a 42-year-old Duffs Road resident, who did not want to be named said that he had seen a man running with a black bag and then heard gunshots. “One of the bullets hit the car. I tried to reverse and drive off but the gunshots just kept going off.  We did not even get off the car to shop. My sister and I were terrified. I managed to drive to the intersection where I stopped to inspect the damages. The metal fragments from the door panel hit my foot,” he said. He was treated at the Mahatma Gandhi Hospital and discharged. Gareth Naidoo, KZN VIP security spokesperson, said two staff members from the store received medical treatment after they were assaulted by the robbers. Daily News
