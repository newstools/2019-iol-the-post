Durban - A video of a snake being removed from a truck has gone viral on social media. The 3-minute video posted by Dala u Crew shows a group of men trying to remove the snake which appears to be dead. The video has received more than 30K views in less than four hours after being posted on Instagram and Facebook. At the end of the video, one of the men stands as he holds the snake for a picture.   Local snake catcher Nick Evans said the snake appeared to be a Southern African Python and approximately 4 metres long. He said snakes go into cars as a safe hiding place. Evans said he had never removed a python from a motor vehicle, but he has removed black mambas and Mozambique spitting cobras. Instagram and Facebook users commented: Celinetracylee: Omg they hurt the beautiful snake. Joyce Shongwe:Â Shabier ShaikÂ hope it's ok and was released back to the wild. Sonita Munsamy: Looks so limpÂ ðŸ˜¥Â Hope it's not dead POST
