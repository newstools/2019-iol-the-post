The Court of First Instance ordered the 27-year-old worker’s deportation after paying a 5000 dirham (R20 500) fine, for stealing the mangoes worth about 6 dirham on August 11, 2017, the Khaleej Times reported. During interrogation and prosecution investigation, the accused recounted that he was working at Terminal 3 of the Dubai airport. His duties included loading travellers luggage on to the conveyer belt from the container and vice versa. He confessed that on August 11, 2017, he stole the mangoes from a fruit box that was to be shipped to India, because he was thirsty and looking for water. In April last year, the police summoned him and interrogated him about the incident. He was arrested and his place was searched. But no stolen items were found. A security officer said he saw the worker on a warehouse CCTV camera opening the traveller’s luggage and stealing. The accused has the right to appeal the verdict. POST
