Rassie Erasmus is set to step down after the Rugby World Cup. The Springboks are preparing for Saturday's final against England where Erasmus will lead the team for the last time. He has been fulfilling a dual role of Director of Rugby as well as Springbok coach since his arrival at SA Rugby. The Boks have improved tremendously in the past few months with Erasmus at the helm. Not only have the team made their way to the final but they have been nominated for World Rugby Team of the Year 2019. Erasmus has also been nominated for World Rugby Coach of the Year, which means a big weekend lies in wait for the team. In a video on the Springbok Twitter account he thanked fans for showing support for the team throughout the tournament. "I would like to say thank you for all your support you guys have been giving us, we can feel it full on, on this side. We really a united team and we know what this means for you guys on that side. We are so excited about this game." Erasmus admitted there are some nerves but allayed fears this might get in the way of the game. "We know there is huge expectations, we are feeling it. We are a bit nervous, the whole team is nervous, I am a bit nervous but we had two great training sessions, there isn't a lot of injuries and the team is well rested and fit. We are happy with with the way preparation went." The match kicks off at 11am on Saturday. IOL Sport
