Durban - Veteran Daily News journalist Farook Khan,75, has died at a Durban hospital where he was being treated for colon cancer on Thursday. Earlier this month, Khan was diagnosed with cancer. On Tuesday evening, Khan underwent a tracheostomy medical procedure — either temporary or permanent — that involves creating an opening in the neck in order to place a tube into a person's windpipe. His relative Nadeem Kara said the Khan family were in shock. Khan, had returned home on Sunday, 8 September, from India after attending the Miss India Pageant. On Monday he complained about stomach pains and the family thought he may have eaten something during the trip that upset his stomach. He was self medicated by family in the interim. The following day his health took a turn for the worse and was rushed to a doctor. He was then taken by ambulance to local hospital where it was discovered that he had cancer. He enjoyed an illustrious career in journalism and later became the chairman of the Culture India Pageant. Khan worked for the Post Newspapers, DRUM Magazine, The Daily News, Sunday Tribune, Star, Pretoria News and Cape Argus titles in Johannesburg, Durban, Pretoria and Cape Town. He had written many newspaper articles in his career on various topics. He also captured the lifestyle of the Grey Street Casbah in a book he wrote titled the Goodwill Lounge. Daily News
