The festival, which was started in 2008 by Jay Pather and Brett Bailey, didn't happen last year for funding reasons. This year the festival received support from UCT, the Mellon Foundation and the African Centre. “Public art is neither recent nor new, certainly not for the African continent,” said ICT curator Pather. “It follows, therefore, that the idea of a public art festival has deep resonance for us on this continent.” The public arts festival includes South African and African artists as well as diverse international artists from the Netherlands, France and Switzerland. Its aim is to involve the city and the people in their collectively-owned public spaces through artworks and performances.

Under the Whale Well, at the South African Museum of Natural History, composer and pianist Nduduzo Makhatini and dancer Kitty Phetla headlined the opening of the festival with their performance Going Back to the Truth of Space on Monday. ITC19 consists of six programmes, three during the day and three in the evenings, routing through the cityscape. The audience will be lead during each route from one artwork to the next, although there’s also a self-guided programme. There will also be eight performances in different spaces from Thibault Square to Wale Street, all the way through St George’s Mall. See: http://infectingthecity.com/2019/ Cape Argus
