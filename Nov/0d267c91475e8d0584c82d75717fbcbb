Durban - A video of a marriage proposal at uShaka Marine World's diving centre has gone viral on social media. The one-minute video clip has garnered over 21k views on the Dala u Crew Facebook page in less than 24 hours. Last week South Africans were captivated by the story of a couple's wedding proposal in a KFC outlet, and culminated in more than 130 pledges for Hector Mkhansi and Nonhlanhla Soldaat to celebrate their second wedding. It amounted to R120 000. In the video, the diver is in the shark tank with the boards: Trish Will you marry me?   People in the crowd can be heard asking who Trish is, and when they finally spot a guy on bended knee with a ring in his hand there are gasps  from the onlookers. The man can be seen placing the ring on a woman's finger and then they kiss, to loud applause from the excited crowd. Initially most people assumed the man in the shark tank was the one proposing but he was clearly just there to catch Trish's attention, and his identity remains a mystery. Social media users commented: Reola Ramsingh: Congratulations guys 🎉 but how much you paid the guy in the tank 🙄🙄 asking for a friend Lyndal Thomas Johnson: Men are so cute these days.i just got a phone call that said.
