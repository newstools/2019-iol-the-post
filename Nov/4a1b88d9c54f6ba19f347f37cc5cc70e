Durban - In honour of the Springboks' glorious victory over their English counterparts on Saturday, Durban artists Ewokessay, Mook Lion, Dane Stops and Giffy, spent their Sunday creating a mural dedicated to the win. The mural has the face of Springboks captain, Siya Kolisi, the coveted Webb Ellis trophy and the emblem of the national rugby team, the springbok.  Pictures of the mural have already been shared in various social media groups with residents applauding the artists' work. Commenting on the post, Martie Clarke said, "Wow Iain. That's amazing and absolutely beautiful." Another resident said, "Beautiful artwork. Well done. Thanks for brightening up the community."

Swing by, say hi, catch a photo with some paint covered guys. 🇿🇦🏉🌍 #springboks #worldchampions #rwc2019 #strongertogether #southafrica #rugby A post shared by  iainEWOKrobinson (@ewokessay) on Nov 3, 2019 at 12:53am PDT      The exceptional @danestops ripping an absolute beauty into @dizypix wall.
