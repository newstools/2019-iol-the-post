Durban - Transnet National Ports Authority had to be ferried to work on Wednesday morning due to massive traffic backlogs at the container terminals. According to Corporate Affairs manager, Ayanda Somagaca, they are addressing the serious traffic congestion at the Bayhead Precinct of the Port of Durban which began on Tuesday. Somagaca said they had arranged the urgent deployment of the SAPS and  Metro Police and terminal operators to assist in alleviating the traffic backlog. "A significant number of employees working across the terminals and depots in the Bayhead and Island View Precincts reported being unable to access their work stations on time for duty. This has led to delays in landside operations which are now having a knock-on effect on waterside operations. In order to overcome this challenge and minimise the impact on operations, TNPA has deployed its waterside craft to ferry employees from the Point Precinct to the Bayhead and Island View Precincts," Somagaca said. She said TNPA has activated its Business Continuity Plan and will keep shipping clients and terminal operators updated regularly around efforts to normalise operations. She said Transnet was aware of an electronic message circulated by transport companies this week calling for a boycott of the Durban Harbour and urging truckers to park off at their depots from 06h00 on Thursday, 28 November until 18h00 on Monday, 2 December. "Such blockades limit access to both Bayhead and Langeberg roads. This impacts the receiving of trucks and landside operations, disrupts economic activity, frustrates neighbouring communities and threatens jobs. Transnet has been working closely with industry bodies to address valid issues raised but appeals for transport companies to engage through the appropriate channels to remain up-to-date on ongoing mitigation measures implemented by Transnet and the progress thereof," Somagaca said.
