We realise that the battle is not over and that this is just the beginning of a new offensive as we wage this war on criminality in KwaZulu-Natal," Jula said. He called on citizens to work with police on the ground and to leave no space for criminals to move freely as we reclaim our streets. "Citizens need to report crimes immediately to enable our rapid response teams to nab criminals in the act or as they flee from crime scenes. We also wish to encourage our citizens to continue reporting crime anonymously via the My SAPS app or Crime Stop on 08600 10111," Jula said. The Mercury
