Durban -Â  A principal at a Phoenix primary school who was charged with rape has been granted bail. The 54-year-old appeared in the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Friday. He was released on R3000 bail. The principal cannot be identified until he pleads because he faces a charge of rape. The case was adjourned to February next year for further investigations. It is alleged that he raped a 39-year-old teacher at the school around mid-morning on Monday. The teacher thereafter reported the incident to the Phoenix SAPS. He was arrested on Wednesday morning at the school. KwaZulu-Natal Education Department spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa said they were disappointed that one of their own is facing such allegations. "Since this incident, we have received three other complaints against this principal. We will now wait for the law to take its course." Mthethwa said this type of behaviour would not be tolerated. In September, a Tongaat teacher charged with statutory rape was suspended by the department following after being charged with sexual abuse for allegedly exchanging messages of a sexual nature with a Grade 11 pupil. He was granted bail of R3 000 and the case was adjourned to next year. According to Mthethwa, the male teacher had allegedly been caught out exchanging graphic material through WhatsApp messages. These include photos and text messages. He said sexual abuse has been as much a constant feature of South African schools as it has been of society in general. "Many of our schools have become violent and unsafe environments, particularly for the girl-child. It is a matter that requires urgent attention from all sectors of the society." POST
