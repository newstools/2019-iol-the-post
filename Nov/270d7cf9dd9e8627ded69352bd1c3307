Durban - Power utility Eskom said its infrastructure was affected by the storm that hit Hanover and other parts of KwaZulu-Natal on Tuesday. "The storm was in the area around Mersey substation, which led to the 33kV Mpolweni feeder to trip," the power utility said in a statement. "Teams are on site and awaiting the storm to subside before evaluating the damage caused." Eskom said residents have experienced power interruptions. Meanwhile, video footage of a tornado believed to have swept through the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, has gone viral on social media. On Tuesday afternoon, residents took to social media to share their videos, which appear to have been taken in the New Hanover area.           According to Storm Report SA, several videos have been shared of different angles of the tornado. Earlier in the day, South African Weather Services issued a storm warning. According to SAWS, severe thunderstorms were predicted for eThekwini, uMshwathi, uMvoti, Nqutu, moving towards iLembe, King Cetshwayo and Ulundi with possible hail and heavy rains that could lead to localised flooding.
