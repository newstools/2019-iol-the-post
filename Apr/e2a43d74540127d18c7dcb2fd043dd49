Durban - A 27-year-old man accused of killing a Reservoir Hills mechanic was denied bail in the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court on Thursday afternoon. Ashen Vishnudath, 27, was arrested and charged for the murder of Navandren Govender. Govender, 30, was reported missing on March 6. His body was found in a bush in Mariannhill hours later. He had sustained three gunshot wounds to the head. It is alleged he was purchasing a car from Vishnudath. However, after failing to pick up his fiancee from work that same evening, alarm bells were raised and the family opened a missing person docket. During the bail application, investigating officer Detective Constable Sherese Mark said they had an eye-witness witness and video footage evidence linking the accused to the crime. She said the State was also in possession of a confession made by the accused and two independent witness statements, which stated they had seen Vishnudath with a firearm. The matter was adjourned to May. POST
