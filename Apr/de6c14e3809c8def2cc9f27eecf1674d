Durban - The city has confirmed that water flowing from Durban taps is safe to drink. The statement was released after bogus information circulating on social media that water in certain areas was laden with pathogens. Pathogens are microorganisms that have a deadly potential to trigger diseases such as diarrhoea. City Manager, Sipho Nzuza, assured residents that water delivered was not contaminated. “We are very concerned with lies making rounds that our water is not clean. Water is very important in sustaining human life and under no circumstances shall we compromise on that. "We have got water experts working for the city who are responsible for ensuring that without fail we provide clean water that is safe to drink. "Even the water that we happen to provide with water tankers in times of emergencies is clean,” said Nzuza. The city said it resolved all water problems in its northern parts and apologised to residents for interruptions of water supply that have been experienced recently. POST
