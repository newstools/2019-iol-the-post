Durban -Â A Phoenix grandfather accused of killing a bedridden woman is expected to appear in Verulam Magistrate's Court today. It is alleged that the 64-year-old man used a large kitchen knife to slit the throat of Dhunalutchmee Naidoo, 69, at her rented flat in Eastbury on Monday. He has been charged with murder. Minutes after the murder the suspect handed himself over to police at the Phoenix Police Station allegedly confessing to the murder. It was the woman's neighbour who raised the alarm bells after she failed to respond to their calls. When officers from VIP Security arrived the home had been locked. Spokesperson Gareth Naidoo said his officers broke down the door to the home to gain access and found the woman laying on the bed. "The woman was lying on the bed and her throat had been slit. She had been bleeding profusely. SAPS were contacted immediately." POST
