Durban - A Phoenix man who shot and killed a man he met on Mxit in 2013 has been sentenced to life in prison in the Durban High Court on Tuesday. Manishvar Ramraj, 34, was killed at his home in Brookdale, Phoenix. His cellphone had also been stolen. The court heard that Ramraj was found dead wearing women's lingerie. Romano Naidoo, 32, was charged for murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances and pleaded not guilty to both counts. Naidoo also denied ever meeting Ramraj or murdering him. Judge Shyam Gyanda found Naidoo guilty and sentenced him to life in jail for the murder. Naidoo received 15 years for robbery and 3 years for unlawful possession of firearm. All sentences will run concurrently. Shortly after the murder in 2013, Naidoo was arrested but charges were provisionally withdrawn that same year. Dissatisfied with the ruling, Ramraj's family had contacted the provincial police and the charges were reinstated. Warrant Officer Rajan Govender of the Provincial Organised Crime Serious and Violent Unit took over the case and Naidoo was re-arrested in 2015. Naidoo is set to serve his sentence at Westville Prison. POST
