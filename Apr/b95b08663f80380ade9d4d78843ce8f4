Durban - The Newlands East mother facing attempted murder charges for allegedly dumping her newborn baby in a stormwater drain, is expected to appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court on Monday. The 32-year-old who was arrested in February is currently out on bail. The baby was rescued after community members heard a baby crying in a stormwater drain in Barracuda Road and Herring Circle in Newlands East. Pictures and video of the 4-hour rescue went viral on social media. Emergency workers had to dig a trench to save the infant who was airlifted to hospital. The mother is currently living with her uncle, a warrant officer at SAPS as per her bail conditions. Also part of her bail conditions was to not have interaction with her two other children, a son aged 15 and a daughter aged 9 without the permission and supervision of a social worker. She was also refrained from entering the Newlands area. The baby named, Sibanisethu, or "Our Light", by members of the community is said to be in good health and in the care of social services. POST
