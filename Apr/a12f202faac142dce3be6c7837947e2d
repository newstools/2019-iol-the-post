Durban - Kandasamys: The Wedding, has raked in R5,7 million at the box office. The sequel to South Africa’s 2017 box office hit Keeping up with the Kandasamys opened last week at the cinemas nationwide. Approximately 100 000 movie-goers watched the movie during the Easter long-weekend, securing its top spot at the South African box office. Jayan Moodley, director and co-writer has been overwhelmed by the response to the movie, saying that the sequel belonged to the fans. “I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: this movie is for the fans! South Africa’s support for the Kandasamys is phenomenal. They’ve owned this film and it is because of them that the Kandasamys is such a huge brand.” The movie stars Jailoshini Naidoo, Maeshni Naicker, Koobeshen Naidoo,  Yugan Naidoo, Mishqah Parthiephal, Madhushan Singh and Mariam Bassa. Centred around the forthcoming wedding of Jodi and Prishen (Mishqah Parthiephal and Madhushan Singh), the mothers Jennifer Kandasamy (Jailoshini Naidoo) and Shanthi Naidoo (Maeshni Naicker) try to push their own agendas for the “big day”. Their subtle (and not so subtle) yet always hilarious antics, recognisable by anyone who has ever had a wedding, create a delicious, rollicking comedy, with husbands adding a foil to an approaching potential pre-wedding melt-down.
