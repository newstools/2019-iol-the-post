"As a filmmaker you want your film to have that reach and for your audience to identify with it. I really think that Kandasamys: The Wedding will again speak to people. We have a phenomenal cast who bring this story to life. The pictures are beautiful, the story is entertaining, full of vibrancy and fun, it will make you laugh and it will make you cry. There’s something in it for everyone.” POST
