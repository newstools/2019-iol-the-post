Durban - The multi-million rand Durban Christian Centre's Jesus Dome is finally taking shape. DCC spokesperson Ron Steele said excitement was mounting as the building took shape following the devastating fire that gutted the Jesus Dome in 2016. It is believed that the illuminated cross at the top of the building had short-circuited because of several power outages that day, and the sparks had fallen into the auditorium which caused the blaze that destroyed the church. In October last year, the iconic arches for the new dome were put up. According to Steele, the roof was nearing completion and the walls around the building were completed. He said while they were initially aiming to complete the building by September this was not going to be possible. "It may be completed by the end of the year but we are refraining from time frames." Steele said only once the roof was completeÂ the construction on the inside would begin. The new church would seat a total of 3 000 congregants. Daily News
