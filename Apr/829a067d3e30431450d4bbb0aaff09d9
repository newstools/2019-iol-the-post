Durban - The city has distanced itself from a false audio message that has been circulating on social media claiming plumbing contractors have not been paid for the past three months and has led to plumbers downing tools. The audio also claims that this was the reason burst pipes were not attended to timeously. "We wish to clarify that the circulating audio message is misleading and untrue. It is also disappointing that certain individuals in the society would stoop this low and peddle lies that are likely to cause unnecessary panic to the public," said Mandla Nsele,  eThekwini Municipality’s Acting Head of Communications. Nsele said the audio made reference to a burst pipe in Essenwood, which the city confirmed is being attended to by their plumbers. "They are currently on site undertaking repairs along Stephen Dlamini Road. The affected area is currently being serviced by a water tanker and we sincerely apologise to residents that are not receiving water normally." POST
