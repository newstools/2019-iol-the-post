Durban - When UKZN student Jivanka Mohan graduated this week she received two sets of good news. The first being that she was graduating with an Honours in Medical Biochemistry summa cum laude; and the second was that she was selected to be part of the exchange programme in Germany. The 22 year old from Glenwood said she was rewarded with this opportunity following her outstanding results. “I was one of two honours students who was given the opportunity to go to Germany, it's an absolute privilege for me and I’m glad that my hard work is finally paying off.” The programme will be held at Hamburg University and hosts top students from all over the world that have excelled in applied sciences. “I am extremely excited to be going overseas and learning more about science in other countries." She thanked her parents for their support. "They made me believe the sky is the limit." She intends on studying towards her Master's degree. Mohan will leave to Hamburg on June 1. POST
