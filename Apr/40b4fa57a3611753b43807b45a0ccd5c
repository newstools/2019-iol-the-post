Durban - The Road Traffic Management Corporation has issued a stern warning to those who try to obtain driving documents illegally. "You will be caught and end up with a criminal record and that has serious repercussions for employment opportunities," said spokesperson Simon Zwane. Zwane was commenting following the conviction and sentencing of four learner licence applicants in the Durban Commercial Crimes Court this week. They were each fined R5000 or five years in jail. Half the sentence was suspended, so each paid an effective R2500. Last year 15 people - nine applicants and six officials - were arrested in a crackdown between RTMC and Hawks at theÂ uMngeni Licensing Office in Howick. In March this year five were convicted and sentenced to five years in jail or R5000 fine. The six other accused will go on trial in June. "We welcome the sentence meted out and we hope this sends a message to members of the public to refrain from trying to obtain their driving documents through underhanded means," said Zwane. Daily News
