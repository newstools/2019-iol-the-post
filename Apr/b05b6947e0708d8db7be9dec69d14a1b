Some of these “fly-by-night” parties will promise their gullible followers all sorts of miracles to better their lives, but there is no magic wand. Unfortunately, the 25 years of democracy have been marred by at least nine years of the “Zupta era”. During this era, the economy almost came to a standstill with the country ending up in the junk yard. Fortunately for ordinary South Africans, it is not a future of doom and gloom. It is perceived that under the able leadership of President Cyril Ramaphosa the country will be steered to a path of recovery. Hopefully, the ruling ANC party is given the chance to create the new dawn of prosperity that South Africans are dreaming about. Imagine what the government could have done for its people if state capture and corruption did not happen? Service delivery protests would not have happened. Some of these newly created parties might see it as an opportunity to enrich themselves if elected. They can very easily sway their followers to believe in their manifestos. Ordinary South Africans must remember to vote wisely for a better future for themselves, their children and grandchildren.  POST
