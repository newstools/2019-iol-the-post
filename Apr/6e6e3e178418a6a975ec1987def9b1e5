Durban - Police are still searching for the suspects who gunned down a tow truck driver in Phoenix on Sunday. According to KZN police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, the victim was in his vehicle parked at Sunford Drive in Phoenix when suspects in a white Etios opened fire. "The victim died at the scene and the motive is unknown." According to Zwane the suspects later hijacked a VW Polo Vivo. "The suspects are still at large. The Toyota Etios which was later recovered was stolen at Sydenham this month," he added. A case of murder has been opened. Prem Balram, director of Reaction Unit SA, said at around 2pm their operations centre received a call for assistance from residents reporting the shooting. "When RUSA paramedics arrived the victim was already being assessed by another service provider and was declared dead on the scene," said Balram. According to Balram the deceased was heading home in his tow truck and was allegedly followed by heavily armed men in a white Toyota Etios. "As the victim stopped outside his home the suspects opened fire on him with high calibre rifles." Balram said the victim's brother managed to return fire by shooting at the suspects' car, but they still got away. The Toyota Etios was later found abandoned on Southbury Drive in Eastbury. POST POST
