The KZN Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo and the Maternal, Adolescent and Child Health organisation (MatCH) will officially welcome them at a ceremony at the KZN Children’s Hospital in South Beach, Durban on Tuesday. "Their recruitment is regarded as a significant step in their personal lives as they will now be able to put food on the table for their families. It is also yet another major boost to the Department’s capacity to provide healthcare services to the public," said Hlongwane. Most of these nurses, the Department said, were recruited from the group who did not make it (due to the limited number of posts) during the massive nurses’ recruitment drive that took place in December 2018. In January Department of Health recruited 300 nurses in Pietermaritzburg. Daily News
