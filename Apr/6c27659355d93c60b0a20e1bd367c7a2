Durban - A third person has been charged with the murder of Bayview teenager Dilano Govender. Police confirmed Govender's aunt Valentina Pillay, 35, was arrested this week. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed Pillay appeared in the Chatsworth Magistrate's Court and was released on bail. Her case has been adjourned to later this month. Her co-accused Huzair Bux, 32, and Dilen Pillay, 25, who also face murder charges appeared in court on Wednesday. It is alleged the shooting was a result of a family dispute. A  day after Govender's murder in January, Bux and Pillay handed themselves and  firearms over to police. Dilano's mother Cheryl Govender said all she wanted was justice. "We believe that police are going to make more arrests. These past few months have been very painful for me, Dilano's father and brother. He is all we talk about and all we think about." Govender said they were praying for justice and that the people responsible will be prosecuted. POST
