Hassan Khan, manager of a packaging company, said four months after his wife, Nasreen, 47, died in a car crash on the N2 freeway near the Higginson Highway off-ramp, the driver of the other vehicle has still not been traced. Nasreen was on her way home on December 16 with her daughters Nabeela, Thasmiya and Maseeha after having their hair and make-up done in preparation for Nabeela’s wedding later that day when the accident happened. “According to my daughters, Nasreen was travelling on the extreme right lane when she flicked her lights to the vehicle in front of her that was travelling very slow to move aside. Instead, the driver of the white Ford Focus that caused the crash slammed on his brakes. “My wife tried to avoid the car and swerved, hit a concrete barrier and flipped. She died at the scene,” said Khan. He said they are appealing to witnesses to come forward. “We have to date been unable to get any video footage from the cameras located on the freeway. According to police they could not see the vehicle registration of the Ford Focus on the video footage. “We know we can never bring my wife back. But we just want closure,” said Khan. Sunday Tribune
