Altaaf, 28, and Alia, 27, Dawood were arrested by the Pietermaritzburg K9 Unit during a stop-and-search in the Raisethorpe area on Sunday night. They have been charged under the National Environmental Management Biodiversity Act. According to one of the police officers, they stopped the driver after they noticed his vehicle “driving all over the place”. He said during the search, a large tusk, worth about R400000, was found wrapped in a black refuse bag on the back seat of the couple’s green VW Golf. It is believed the couple was on the way to sell the tusk. They appeared in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court yesterday facing charges of conducting restricted activities involving threatened or protected species without a permit under the National Act. Alia was released on R1000 bail while Altaaf was remanded in custody. POST
