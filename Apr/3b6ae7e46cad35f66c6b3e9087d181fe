Durban - The KZN MEC of Education Mthandeni Dlungwana is expected to visit a primary school in Durban on Tuesday morning following allegations of sexual harassment and intimidation levelled against the principal. “These are serious allegations and we need to get to the bottom of this issue," said Dlungwana ahead of the visit to the primary school situated in Umbilo. There are allegations that the principal allegedly sexually harassed his staff and threatened to kill them if they reported his conduct to anyone. "It is our duty to protect our employees and if we find these allegations to be true, we are definitely going to take drastic actions,” added the MEC. The MEC is expected to "dig deep" into the issues at the school. In October Educators’ Union of South Africa (EUSA) said School principals found to be “bullies” will soon face the music. The Daily News reported that EUSA president Scelo Isaac Bhengu said their investigations indicated that many teachers were under too much stress and were suffering depression from being bullied.
