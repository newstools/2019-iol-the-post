Durban - Revenge was the reason Mohamed Vahed Ebrahim decided to kidnap and kill 9-year-old Miguel Louw. This is what the State has alleged in indictments served in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Thursday morning. Ebrahim, 43, faces charges of murder and kidnapping following the disappearance of Miguel in July 2018. The decomposed body of the Rippon Road Primary School pupil was found on a vacant piece of land in Phoenix in September. Shortly after the kidnapping, Ebrahim was arrested and later charged with murder. In a two page indictment, the State alleges that Ebrahim who lives in Longbury Phoenix occasionally lived at Miguel's home in Sydenham and performed odd jobs around their home. It further states that prior to the incident Ebrahim and Miguel's mother had an argument. "As a result, the accused decided to kill the deceased in order to exact revenge on the deceased's mother." During the afternoon of July 17, the accused allegedly lured Miguel from his school to a nearby food outlet and purchased food for him and left with him. It further reads that at some stage, and in circumstances unknown to the State, the accused killed the deceased and left his body in a bushy area adjacent to Longbury Drive in Phoenix. The indictment stated cause of death could not be ascertained due to the decomposition of the body but suffocation should be considered. The State is expected to call 23 witnesses. Daily News
