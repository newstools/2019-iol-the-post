Philip Moodley, 36, was leaving the bank on Compton Street in Pinetown and making his way to his vehicle, where his stepchildren and son-in-law had been waiting, when he saw four men approaching. His son-in-law, Justin Gounder, said the group had demanded his cellphone and bracelet, which he gave to them. “As soon as the men walked away, I started chasing after them. “He (Moodley) was walking out of the bank and saw me chasing after the men and he followed. The next thing, I saw him fall. “As I ran over to him, I noticed he was not looking good. He appeared to have been having a heart attack. I attempted to perform CPR to resuscitate him but he died on the pavement.” Gounder said that a day earlier Moodley was robbed of two cellphones, also in Pinetown. Moodley, a site manager for roads maintenance, was buried on Monday. POST
