Durban - The father of Miguel Louw's murder accused died shortly after his son was indicted to appear in the Durban High Court on Thursday. A close relative said Ebrahim Shah, 77, had taken ill since his son's previous appearance and had been on a downward spiral. Murder accused Mohamed Ebrahim Vahed is on trial for the death of the Durban schoolboy. Vahed had appeared on Thursday morning in the Durban Regional Court where he is facing charges of murder and kidnapping. His case was transferred to the Durban High Court. Shah, who had been to court for each of the cases, was unable to attend Thursday's court proceedings due to ill health. Shah apparently cried out to see his son who is currently behind bars at the Durban Central police holding cells. He would be transported back to Westville Correctional Services later. The case, said a family friend, had taken a huge toll on Shah's health. The Miguel Louw murder has grabbed headlines around the world. Louw, 9, had been picked up from his school in Sydenham by Vahed and allegedly taken to Phoenix in July 2018. Louw's decomposed body was found a month later near Vahed's home in Longbury, Phoenix.
