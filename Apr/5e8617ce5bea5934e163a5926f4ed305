In a progress update sent to prospective tenants, AJ Property Holdings said building contractors were now active on site with demolition work in full swing. It said the opening date of the centre had to be moved to November 26, 2020, to allow the developers enough time to build something of the quality and standard that the community deserved. Popular stores such as Checkers, Cambridge, Clicks, Pep, Ackermans, Tekkie Town, Cell C, MTN, Spec Savers, McDonaldâ€™s, Ma Baker and Chicken Xpress are expected to take residence in the mall. Something new, said the team, was a lava lounge and restaurant that would be unique to oThongathi. In March, a cleansing ceremony was held to give closure to the families who lost loved ones in the 2013 mall collapse. Following the tragedy, the property was sold by controversial property developer Jay Singh to AJ Property Holdings, in partnership with Proproyale Developments for R32 million. POST
