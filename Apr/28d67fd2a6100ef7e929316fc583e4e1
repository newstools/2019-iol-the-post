Durban - A 21-year- old who accosted his victim at gunpoint and raped her was jailed for 20 years. Siyanda Ntombela was sentenced in the Pietermaritzburg Regional Court this week. Ntombela accosted the 34-year-old woman in August 2017 in the Edendale area in Pietermaritzburg. KZN police Captain Nqobile Gwala said the victim had been walking with a companion and her daughter when they were approached by a known suspect who jumped out from the bushes. "At gunpoint he instructed the companion to leave after firing shots into the air. The daughter managed to escape but the victim was dragged into a house that was in the vicinity where she was raped," said Gwala. The owner of the house arrived and the accused fled the scene on foot in an unknown direction." A case of rape was opened at Plessislaer SAPS and was transferred to the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit. The accused was arrested shortly thereafter. This week Sbonelo Ngcobo, 22, was sentenced to 40 years for raping two women, one of them being a pensioner. Daily News
