Durban - A Chatsworth church has opened its doors to 20 people who have been displaced since Mondays flash floods that left 51 dead and hundreds injured. AFM Miracle Tabernacle in Westcliff is providing temporary shelter to the victims. Pastor Selvan Govender from People's Church of God, who is part of the committee, said more people were expected to arrive today. In addition to providing temporary accommodation, the church was instrumental in providing meals to about 140 people who were being housed at the Bayview Community Hall, Cashew Road Informal settlement and Nelson Mandela Youth Centre. Govender said in light of the tragedy it was most heartwarming to see the community "come together." â€œPeople have been very emotional and devastated by what has taken place." He said the church has been assisting the family that were killed in the Westcliff home collapse where 8 people, including two toddlers, lost their lives. POST
