Durban - POLICE are appealing for assistance after a karate instructor, who was assaulted earlier in the month, died in hospital. Dheenadayalan Reddy, 52, was at Hotel Savera in Kharwastan, with friends on April 5 when he was allegedly attacked. According to police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele Pillay was hospitalised due to the severity of his injuries. “He died in hospital on Tuesday. Chatsworth police are appealing to the public to assist police in identifying the suspects," Mbele said. Reddy, an instructor at Shotokan Karate International South Africa, was with his friends when an argument broke out. He was allegedly hit with a bar table and kicked in the stomach. Reddy allegedly drove home where the family had rushed him to hospital. According to Chatsworth community activist, Pastor Selvan Govender, the community had been upset at the assault and were trying to assist police where possible. “It's really sad to hear of the passing of Dheena, he was at a place of entertainment and didn't deserve what transpired. “He was deaf and misunderstood in the altercation. Security is of a concern if an incident of this nature can take place at an entertainment environment. We are doing our best to assist police however we can and hope that an arrest is made soon.” POST
