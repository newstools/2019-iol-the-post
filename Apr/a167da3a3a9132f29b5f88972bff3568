DURBAN - A total of 5000 reservists are due to be called up to enhance security during the national general elections, taking place on May 8. This is according to National Police Commissioner, General Khehla John Sitole. "In addition to this, 5 000 trainees currently undergoing trainees as police academies, will be placed on standby as a contingency, should the need arise to complete the dedicated team that has already been assigned to ensure a safe environment for the conducting of free and fair elections," Sitole said. He was commenting following recent rumblings within the police force which saw disciplinary action being taken against 40 protesting police officers in Durban on Monday. The members were arrested after they marched to the KZN SAPS headquarters in Bram Fischer Road to hand over a Memorandum of Understanding to KZN police commissioner, Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi. According to SAPS national spokesperson, Vish Naidoo, discussions between provincial police management and aggrieved members continued until 2am on Tuesday morning. Naidoo said the members are likely to face charges in terms of the Gathering Act, the Road Traffic Act, the SA Police Disciplinary Regulations and municipal bylaws. THE MERCURY
