Durban - A  physically challenged woman was found dead in her flat in Phoenix a short while ago. According to KZN VIP Security spokesperson Gareth Naidoo the woman's throat had been slit. It was the woman's neighbour who raised the alarm bells after she failed to respond to their calls. "When our officers arrived at the scene the woman's house was locked," said Naidoo. "A window was slightly open and the officers saw the woman lying on the bed. They called out to her but she did not respond. The officers then broke down the door to gain entry into the home." Naidoo said they went into the bedroom to found the woman's lifeless body. "Her throat had been slit and she was bleeding profusely. Officers contacted Phoenix SAPS for assistance." Naidoo said the woman is believed to be in her late 50's. "According to neighbours she was wheelchair bound and lived with a man. The motive of the attack is unknown at the moment," concluded Naidoo. Phoenix police have confirmed that they are investigating a case of murder. POST
