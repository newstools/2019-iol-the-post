Durban - A man was killed on the Higginson Highway on Saturday after a vehicle ploughed into him. According to Garrith Jamieson from Rescue Care Paramedics, it is alleged that the vehicle broke down on the highway and as the passenger was alighting from the vehicle a vehicle ploughed into them. "The man believed to be in his late twenties had sustained major injuries and unfortunately, there was nothing paramedics could do for him and he was declared deceased on the scene." Jamieson said the three other occupants from both vehicles had sustained various injuries and once stabilised on the scene they were transported to a nearby hospital for the further care that they required. SAPS were on scene. The accident took place just before 10 pm. An hour later a man has sustained serious injuries after he was entrapped in his vehicle when he collided into a vehicle on Marine Drive towards Merebank. "Rescue Care Paramedics arrived on the scene to find that two vehicles had collided in a T Bone Format. The one driver was entrapped in his vehicle and whilst Advanced Life Support Paramedics worked to stabilise him on the scene rescuers worked to free him. Once freed he was extricated from the vehicle and loaded into an awaiting ambulance. He was then transported to a nearby hospital for the further care that he required. The second driver had sustained minor injuries and chose to refuse hospital treatment," said Jamieson. Daily News
