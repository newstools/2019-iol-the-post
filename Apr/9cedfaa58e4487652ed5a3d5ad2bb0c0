Durban - The man accused of murdering an Amaoti infant whose decomposed body was found in a park in Phoenix appeared in the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Monday. Thembelani Mtengwana, 31, was arrested in the Eastern Cape following an intelligence-driven operation, police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said. According to East Coast Radio, the child's father who was in court is demanding justice for his murdered son. He told ECR that Mtengwana lived in the same area as them and that he would sometimes see him walking on the road. The infant was snatched from his home two weeks ago and a missing person report was opened. Last Wednesday the child's decomposed body was found in a park in Trenance Manor. “Phoenix SAPS officers worked tirelessly following possible leads to locate a suspect involved in the murder of a child. “The officers were led to Eastern Cape, where the suspect was arrested and brought to SAPS Phoenix where he is being detained,” said Zwane. Zwane said a post mortem would be conducted to confirm the cause of death. The case was adjourned to next week. Daily News
