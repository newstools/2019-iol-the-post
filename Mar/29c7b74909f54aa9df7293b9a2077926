Durban- KZN Cogta is offering a R100 000 reward for information leading to the arrest of individuals responsible for the torching of departmental offices in Mayville in the early hours of Thursday morning. The department said SAPS and Fire Services were still working on the scene of the fire. The building served as office space for Cogta Officials and Traditional Leadership support. “A preliminary assessment of the damages to the park homes that have been burned to the ground is in excess of R17-million. The figure does not include valuable files and critical documents. Such wanton destruction of government property cannot go unpunished. We will see to it that the perpetrators are brought to book,” said KZN MEC for Cogta Nomusa Dube-Ncube. "This is direct sabotage of the state infrastructure which ends up having dire consequences on innocent residents who rely on government services such as the ones provided by our department. We are calling upon law enforcement agencies to leave no stone unturned in their pursuit of the perpetrators of this dastardly deed. POST
