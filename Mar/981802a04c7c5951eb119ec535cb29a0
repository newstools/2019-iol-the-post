Durban - Two women were trapped in a Mercedes Benz after it crashed into a home in the Verulam CBD, next to the Metro Police offices, on Tuesday. Head of Reaction Unit South Africa Prem Balram said they were called out to the scene around 12.30pm. "Upon arrival firefighters from the eThekwini Fire and Rescue Services were in the process of removing the trapped women. With the use of pneumatic (power)  tools the passenger door was opened and one of the women was freed." He said the 68-year-old driver sustained head and spinal injuries. "She was extricated from the vehicle by medics and fireman before being transported to Umhlanga Hospital. According to the driver, she was approaching her home when she felt dizzy and weak. Instead of turning into her driveway she suddenly accelerated towards her home." He said the vehicle ploughed through a wooden barrier before it crashed into the home which is a few meters below road level. The passenger was not injured in the accident. POST
