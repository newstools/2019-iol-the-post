Durban - The DA is calling for immediate housing allocation for Isipingo transit camp residents following a recent oversight visit to the area. According to the DA whip Zamani Khuzwayo, the camps which were meant to be temporary after people moved in, for preparation for the 2010 World Cup has become a "living hell" for residents. "Residents of Isipingo's Ward 90 Transit camp have been subjected to living under atrocious and unhealthy conditions for close to ten years now. There is no running water, proper ablution facilities, and poor electricity connections," said Cllr Khuzwayo. Councillor Khuzwayo said children were plagued by numerous water-borne diseases due to lack of basic sanitation and cleanliness. He alleged that no update was received by the municipality on housing the residents. "As things stand, residents have no idea how the few beneficiaries who have been given houses were chosen." Councillor Khuzwayo said they will continue to fight for the poor and will hold those responsible for housing to account. The City has been approached for comment. POST
