Durban - A Pietermaritzburg judge is expected to rule next month on whether convicted murderer Rajivee Soni can appeal his guilty conviction. Soni began his appeal application in the Durban High Court in December last year. Arguments were concluded last week and the judge is expected to make a ruling on April 11. The matter has been transferred back to Pietermaritzburg. If successful Soni could apply for bail pending his hearing. The Pietermaritzburg businessman was jailed to 30 years for the 2013 murder of Pietermaritzburg doctor Bhavish Sewram. Sewram, a father of two, was shot outside his surgery in Raisethorpe. Soni believed that his wife, Kerusha, and Sewram were involved in a romantic relationship. He enlisted the help of former policeman Brian Treasurer. Treasurer, who was serving a life sentence died in prison. On September 19, the Pietermaritzburg High Court found Soni guilty on six charges including murder and conspiracy to commit murder. He began serving his prison sentence in October at the New Hanover Prison. Daily News
