Durban - The City confirmed that water tankers had been dispatched to areas in the North Coast affected with water cuts.Ntuzuma and some parts of Inanda and Amatoanna have been without water due to a power failure at the Ntuzuma Reservoir 2 since March 27. Msawakhe Mayisela, spokesperson for the City said that this led to the reservoir being emptied. "The reservoir will take some time to refill." Areas like Desainagar, La Mercy and Sea Tides are facing water cuts due to a burst water pipe at the Airport reservoir. Mayisela said technicians were working to repair the faults and water will be restored as soon as possible. "The city calls on communities to be patient and use water sparingly even when supply returns." Last week the City said a water rationing schedule doing its round on social media was a hoax. The schedule lists areas in Tongaat and Verulam and La Mercy which could face daily water cuts for up to eight hours at a time. POST
