Durban - Residents from Durban CBD and Overport who have been given eviction notices to make way for proposed student accommodation braved the heat and marched to the Durban City Hall on Wednesday morning. Carrying placards the group handed over a memorandum to City Mayor Zandile Gumede. The residents from Syringa Avenue, in Warwick Avenue and Overport, are asking for Government to intervene. Edith Reedy, a long term resident at Syringa Avenue said she was not only fighting for her family but all those affected. "Where does a 70-year-old granny with a pension of R1500 where does she move to. She can't afford a flat for R10 000. How will she survive?" She said residents were not there to "harass the municipality" but knew that it was the City that held the contracts for student accommodation and businessmen were manipulating the system. "We are coming to you with our petition and saying enough is enough. The municipality is supposed to wake up now." The Mayor, who was unable to attend sent through a representative on behalf of her to receive the memorandum. POST
