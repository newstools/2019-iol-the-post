Cardiac patient, Shunmugam “Shan” Naicker, 69, pictured, of Waddington Close, was en route the Umbilo Temple in Cato Manor when he lost control of the car on Piet Retief Road. He managed to drive into the garage but the car rolled and crashed into a forklift. His niece, attorney Omashni Leeladhar, said they had seen CCTV footage, which showed him being assaulted by a man alleged to be the forklift driver until he was unconscious. “He was punched, kicked, held by his collar and thrown onto a verge outside the garage.” The father of two was taken to the hospital and regained consciousness the following day. He had been kept on a ventilator. “Later that night, he again slipped into a coma and on Thursday he passed away.” She said a case had been opened but no one had been taken in for questioning. Naicker’s funeral was held yesterday. The family await the outcome of the post-mortem report and will consider their legal options. Police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala said an inquest docket had been opened. POST
