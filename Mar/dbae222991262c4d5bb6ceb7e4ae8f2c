Durban - An Isipingo grocery store received a R4000 fine after a raid by the national consumer commission and City officials found that they had been selling expired sauces and spices. The business compliance inspection blitz which took place on Thursday in the Isipingo CBD ties in with World Consumer Rights Day, which is being commemorated tomorrow. The inspection team comprises of officials from the Departments of Health, Water, Electricity and EconomicTransformation. Officials from business licence and building inspectors made their way to Progress Centre on Phila Ndwandwe Road in Isipingo and thereafter to the neighbouring Pick n' Win building. A eatery which was operating without a business licence was fined R4 000 for dirty conditions, not having a proper storage area and for a faulty extraction system among other things. Some of the businesses were closed which indicated that they may have been tipped off about the blitz. The last raids took place in November in Isipingo and Tongaat. POST
