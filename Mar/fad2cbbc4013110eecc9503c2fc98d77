Durban - Friends and family of Demisha Naik who was murdered earlier this week, gathered at her Shallcross home on Thursday morning to pay their final respects. The 23-year-old beautician’s body was found in her flat on Tuesday evening - she had been stabbed to death. A day after her death the 24-year-old suspect wanted for her murder was found dead. KZN police spokesperson Lt Colonel Thulani Zwane said police found the 24-year-old man inside the house with a gunshot wound through the chest at his home in Montford. "He was declared dead and a pistol was found on the scene." At the funeral service, a picture frame of Naik was placed on the white casket along with bouquets of flowers.
