Durban - Police are still searching for two men who allegedly fell of a bridge into a river in Verulam on Sunday. Prem Balram, director of Reaction Unit SA, said the two men who are presumed to have drowned, were washed off the bridge in Mslasini in Everest Heights following the heavy downpour on Sunday afternoon. "On Sunday evening, a local councillor contacted Reaction Unit South Africa, after he witnessed the two men being washed off the bridge during a heavy downpour. It is believed the men had been intoxicated at the time.” Balram said his officers together with Metro Police, Verulam Police and the SAPS Search and Rescue Services searched along the river without success. “The search was called off due to the heavy current and poor lighting.” He said at first light on Monday morning, the Reaction Unit Robinson R44 Helicopter will take off to assist rescuers in their search for the missing men.
