Durban - Two men are in a critical condition following a drive-by shooting in Avoca Hills, Durban earlier today. Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst said paramedics responded to the shooting incident in Queen Nandi Drive at around midday. “Reports from the scene indicate that gunmen had opened fire on a car near the Emgidwini intersection,” said Herbst. "It is believed that the suspects pulled up next to the victim's car in a red Toyota Etios and began to fire multiple rounds at the occupants who were in their car," said Herbst. Herbst said that occupants - two males - sustained multiple gunshot wounds and required advanced life support. "They were assessed on scene and was found to be in a critical condition and was thereafter transported to a hospital." Herbst said SAPS were on scene to investigate the motive behind the incident.
