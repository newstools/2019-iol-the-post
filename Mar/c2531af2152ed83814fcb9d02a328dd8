Durban -Â A 10-year-old boy is in a critical condition after falling from a window of a third-floor apartment block in Pietermaritzburg Central on Thursday afternoon. ER24 spokesperson Ross Campbell said it is not known how the boy managed to fall from the window. "He had suffered multiple injuries and Advanced Life Support interventions were administered before he was taken to Grey's Hospital for further treatment." Last month, Akeel Jugdeo, a Grade 5 pupil who lived in a flat in East Street, plunged 10-storeys to his death from a bathroom window. The 10-year-old had allegedly told his mother, Kapashnie Jugdeo, he was going to the toilet. When she realised he had been gone for a while she called out for him but there was no response. The bathroom door was locked but she managed to break it down. The mother could not find Akeel and when she looked out of the bathroom window, she saw him lying on the roof of another building. The child, a pupil at the Shri Vishnu Primary School, sustained broken bones and head injuries. He died at the scene. POST
