Durban - Veteran cop Rajan 'RM' Govender of the city’s organised crime unit is heading the murder investigation of Siam Lee. The latest development was revealed as the trial began in the Durban High Court on Monday. Lee's charred remains were found on a farm in New Hanover, in the Midlands in January 2018. The 20-year-old was a sex worker in Durban North. The man accused of her murder is 30 years old and is believed to have been a former client of Lee's. He cannot be named because he faces rape charges and is yet to plead. He is out on R40 000 bail and made his first appearance in the Durban High Court on Monday. The matter was adjourned to April 11 for a provisional date for pre-trial hearings. Govender is also investigating the murder case of Miguel Louw, whose decomposed body was found in a shallow grave in Phoenix in September. His alleged killer is out on bail. Other cases Govender has investigated include: * Malvern mother Nalin Naidu who was allegedly murdered by her husband in 2014. Her husband Seelan died in prison while awaiting trial in 2016.
