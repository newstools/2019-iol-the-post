Durban - The Phoenix father who allegedly shot his wife before turning the gun on himself was buried on Monday afternoon. Zane Smith, 28, who was self-employed, allegedly shot his wife Berine Haines, 34, a nurse at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital, in the head during a domestic dispute at their rented home in Palmview. Their children aged 7 and 2 were at home during the shooting but were not harmed. They have since moved in with Smith's mother. Haines funeral is expected to take place later this week at her family home in Ixopo. She started working at the hospital in 2010 as a professional nurse in the Mental Health Care Unit. She had a diploma in nursing and midwifery. The MEC for Health, Sibongiseni Dhlomo, who is also the chairperson of the KZN Men's Forum, encouraged men to protect their families and to better handle disagreements. "We are calling upon men to restrain themselves from solving domestic disputes in this way." Police KZN spokesperson Lt-Col Thulani Zwane said a case of murder and an inquest were opened at the Phoenix police station. "A 9mm pistol was found next to the bodies. Circumstances surrounding their killing are under investigation." POST
