Durban - DOVES were released during the emotional funeral service of nurse Berine Haines at her hometown of Ixopo on Saturday. Haines, 34, who was employed at Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital, was shot in the head by her husband, Zane Smith, during a domestic dispute, at their rented home in Palmview, Phoenix.   Smith, who is self-employed, then turned the gun on himself. He was buried a day after the shooting. Their children aged 7 and 2 were at the home during the incident but were unharmed.Â  They are now being cared for by Haines mother. Her funeral service was held at the Hlutankungu Catholic Church in Ixopo. Her cousin Selma Haines said saying goodbye was hard. "Berine was taken from us in such a tragic manner and we released the doves at her funeral because they are a symbol of peace and we believed it would guide her spirit to heaven." Haines said this gave her family, friends and work colleagues comfort. "Our concern now is the well being of her children. With us around her daughter seems to be doing well but her little boy constantly cries for his mother. It is just too heartbreaking." Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said police are investigating a case of murder with respect to Haines death and an inquest has been open into Smith's death. POST
