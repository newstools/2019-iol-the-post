Durban - Murdered Chatsworth teenagerÂ Dilano Govender would have celebrated his 20th birthday today but his life was snatched from him when he was fatally shot during an alleged family dispute in January. The men accused of his murder, Huzair Bux, 32, and Dilen Pillay, 25, were charged for his murder, after handing themselves and their guns over to police. The accused, who are currently out on bail, made a brief appearance in the Chatsworth Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. The case was remanded to April 3 for further investigations. Govender was shot in the neck and leg during a family dispute outside his Bayview home. He died en-route to the RK Khan Hospital. His father Eugene said having to attend court on his birthday and facing the accused was very difficult for him and his wife, Cheryl. "We are devastated it kills us, even more, to see the accused smiling and laughing in court like our son's life does not matter. We pray every day for justice." Eugene said the night before his son's death he spoke of having a party to celebrate his birthday. "He wanted his family and friends present. Instead of a party, we are holding a memorial in his honour." POST
