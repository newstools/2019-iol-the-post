DURBAN - This month 56-year-old George Charalambus will be on his way to donate his blood platelets and plasma for the 201st time. His 200 donations at the South African National Blood Service over the past 17 years have helped hundreds of cancer patients. Charalambus, from Durban, is a specialist blood donor, which means he is among those who are able to donate blood platelets and plasma. Each month, he undergoes the one-hour process for his blood to be passed through a machine that separates plasma and platelets from the blood. The platelets help cancer patients who go through radiotherapy which destroys their blood-clotting agents. The plasma is given to burn victims, and used to make rabies vaccines. SANBS spokesperson Sifiso Khoza said there were cancer and anemic patients who relied on donation daily to stay alive. “(Charalambus) is indeed one of a kind. His donations have given patients chances to see another birthday, another anniversary,” he said. More than 31 years ago, Charalambus’s father died after being diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. “I’ve always wanted to help people who are suffering with cancer, and this is one way to do that. Cancer is more common than you think, especially among children. We will never understand the pain they are suffering, but donating will help them in some way,” he said. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
