Durban - A PHOENIX man accused of stealing a thali chain (sacred marital chain) worth R50 000 from a La Lucia grandmother is still behind bars. Ronaldo Chetty, 30, was arrested on October 25, a day after he allegedly conned the 72-year-oldÂ senior citizen into handing over the 50-year-old thali, a cellphone and R700 cash. He appeared briefly in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Thursday and the case was adjourned until the end of March. Chetty was denied bail in December. State Prosecutor Kuveshnie Pillay told the court that since Chetty's arrest a total of 8 victims had come forward. Pillay said that Chetty could face more charges and that all the charges would be consolidated at his next appearance. In January 2018, Chetty allegedly conned an elderly man into handing over R2500 for a parcel and, in March, he conned an elderly woman of R200 and three gold bangles. Chetty was remanded back to Westville prison. POST
