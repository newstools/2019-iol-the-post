Samantha Natalia Naicker, 27, had been a passenger in her father’s car. She was travelling with her father on the K43 Highway near Volta Road, on their way to pick up her husband in Lenasia South on Friday evening. It is alleged that the driver of a white bakkie hooted and drove close to their car while shouting at them. A relative, who declined to be named, said her father pulled on to the side of the road, as did the other driver. “Both jumped out of the car to speak to the man when he suddenly took off and drove straight into her.” Naicker was declared dead at the scene. “She has a three-year-old son, who is asking for his mother. We need anyone with information or who witnessed the incident to please come forward so justice can be served.” Anyone with information can call 079 567 8445. POST
