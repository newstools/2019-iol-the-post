Durban - A 43-year-old man who allegedly hijacked two truck drivers on two different occasions appeared in the Chatsworth Magistrate's Court on Thursday. Rodney Ragunandan, from Westcliff, Chatsworth, faces two charges of hijacking. He was arrested on Tuesday by Chatsworth SAPS outside a bottle store in Westcliff. He has been remanded back to Chatsworth SAPS. Ragunandan is expected to apply for bail on March 13. Ragunandan and another accused are alleged to have lured two truck drivers during the period of December and January on the pretence of wanting them to transport goods for them. They would then allegedly hijack the truck. His co-accused, who police are still searching for, is alleged to have produced a firearm during the hijacking. Ragunandan who is single did not have any legal representation in court on Thursday. The trucks were hijacked in Chatsworth, one in the vicinity of the Silverglen Nature Reserve and have not been recovered to date. Daily News
