Durban - A warrant of arrest has been issued for a Durban mother accused of murdering her 7 year old son after she failed to appear in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Friday morning. Megan Prins, 34, is alleged to have drugged her son Sloan before suffocating him in an Umhlanga guest house in June 2018. Prins, who is out on R3000 bail, worked as a project manager in the medical field. While the matter was set down for further investigation, the Magistrate ruled in November that it was the final date for the outstanding documents - which included post-mortem and DNA results - could be handed into court. As part of Prins' bail conditions, she is not allowed to make contact with State witnesses and has to report to the Mayville police station every  Monday and Friday. She is also not allowed to relocate from the address she is currently living at. Daily News
