Durban - WHILE the body of one of the two men who drowned in a river in Verulam was recovered on Monday, one person is still missing. Prem Balram, director of Reaction Unit South Africa, who had assisted police in the search and rescue by doing helicopter searches said it is possible the second person managed to crawl out of the river. "We are 99.9% sure the second person managed to jump out of the river. "At the moment we do not know who he may be because no one else has been reported missing and the only person that could identify him is Ngcobo, who has passed on.” "However the search for him will continue." The body of Kenneth Ngcobo was recovered late on Monday evening. His body had been trapped among the reeds in the river. Balram said Ngcobo, who had been living alone in Verulam, was identified by members of his family. POST
