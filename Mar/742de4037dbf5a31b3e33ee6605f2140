Sehera’s cousin and mother said they wanted to make the Ashton College International pupils’ entrance memorable. “Shivani Govender, the owner of the Desi Motion Dance School, and I are friends and we called her and explained what we wanted to achieve and they delivered,” said Sehera’s cousin, Avish Bhadhai. Sehera’s mother, Suhana, added: “She is this incredibly, humble soul, who gets on and does things quietly in life. For her 16th birthday in 2017, she climbed Mount Kilimanjaro to raise awareness and funds for an NGO that collects sanitary towels for underprivileged girls. “Sehera is currently a Trek100 Ambassador and has been invited to speak at a dinner being held by the organisation for Thuli Mandonsela and her team, who are preparing to climb Kilimanjaro. She is also an ambassador for the NGO, Caring4Girls.” Suhana added that her daughter loved Bollywood and, coming from a diverse school in Benoni, it was an opportunity to also express her culture. Sehera, who learnt about the flame dancers when they arrived at the venue in a vintage Mercedes-Benz, said: “Everyone was really taken aback.” POST
