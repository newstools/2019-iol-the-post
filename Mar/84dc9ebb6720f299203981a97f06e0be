Durban - IFP MP Narend Singh has expressed sadness over the passing of party leader Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi’s wife princess Irene Audrey Thandekile Buthelezi. News broke shortly after midday that the princess passed away on Monday morning at their KwaPhindangene residence. Singh said he knew the mother of three well and was saddened by her death. “She was a great lady. She stood by the prince as a wife and supporter, she stood tall as a mother and grandmother. The news came as a shock.” He said Prince Buthelezi is also processing the news. “It's really shocking. They were married for 67 years.” Earlier today the Buthelezi family released a statement saying that the princess died following a “long and difficult illness.” She leaves behind her husband, their children Prince Ntuthukoyezwe Zuzifa, Princess Phumzile Nokuphiwa and Princess Sibuyiselwe Angela, and many grandchildren who are all devastated by this loss.
