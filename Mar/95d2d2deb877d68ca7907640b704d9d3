Dr Feroz Ganchi, a former surgeon at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital, was stationed at a refugee camp along with his wife, Safiya Ibrahim, a psychiatrist, and their daughter when tragedy struck. According to reports, his wife and daughter’s whereabouts are unknown at this stage. Dr Imtiaz Sooliman, founder and chairperson at Gift of the Givers, said he met Ganchi in 2009 in Egypt when he became part of his medical team who were headed to Gaza. “I last saw him at the airport in Egypt where he was kept behind for further questioning related to an incident in Pakistan a few years ago on suspicion of having links to al-Qaeda.” Sooliman said when the team returned to South Africa three weeks later, he was not with him. “I think Dirco brought him home about three weeks later, but I have never seen him since.” The family’s lawyer, Yousha Tayob described Ganchi as a humanitarian.
