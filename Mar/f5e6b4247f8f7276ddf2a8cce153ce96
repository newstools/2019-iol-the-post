Durban - A 7-year-old boy was held at gunpoint during a robbery at his home in Hillary on Monday night. Blue Security community and media liaison officer Andreas Mathios said four armed robbers arrived in a white VW Polo and forced their way into the family’s home. “The suspects forced open a door and entered the house where they held up the family at gunpoint. They forced the resident, his wife and one child into a room of the house and kept one child with them. They took the child to the lounge and pointed a firearm at him while they removed televisions from the property." He said when the suspects were in the process of leaving the premises a resident arrived at the scene, disturbing them. "One of the suspects fired a shot before they fled in their getaway vehicle. No injuries were reported,” said Mathios. In a separate incident, robbers held up a Kharwastan family last week and threaten to shoot their one-year-old baby is they did not co-operate. POST
