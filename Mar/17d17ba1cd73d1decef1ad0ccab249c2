Several sources, who declined to be named, said Pillay was expected to report for duty either tomorrow or Friday. They claimed he had been cleared of sexual harassment charges, which had come to the fore during an independent commission of inquiry at the SABC which started in May. Pillay could not be reached for comment by the time of publication. SABC spokesperson Neo Momodu said Pillay’s disciplinary hearing took place on February 21. “The SABC is currently considering the report and recommendations of the disciplinary panel.” Staff at the station said they had not been informed about the outcome of the hearing, or that Pillay could be returning to work. A former staff member claimed that the charges against him had been dropped. During the inquiry, independent commissioners accepted verbal and written allegations of sexual harassment, from the current and former employees. The findings revealed that the SABC was complicit in some cases, by turning a blind eye to its sexual harassment policies. At the time, inquiry chairperson Barbara Watson said the SABC’s sexual harassment policies did not meet international standards and needed to be reviewed. POST
