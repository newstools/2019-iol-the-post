Durban - A three-week police operation led to the recovery of 50 stolen vehicles valued at more than R8 million. The operation was held between February 4 until February  22, focusing on syndicates that steal and hijack vehicles. Members of the Vehicle Crime Investigation Units from Isipingo, Port Shepstone, Empangeni and Alexandra Road as well as Crime Intelligence and Visible Policing conducted the operation throughout the province to deal with the threat of cloned vehicles. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the focus was on vehicles taken with the intention of altering their identification numbers. “These vehicles are sold back onto the black market to those willing to purchase such vehicles. “Swoops were conducted in the eThekwini region, Port Shepstone, Pietermaritzburg and Empangeni areas. The majority of these vehicles that were recovered were either robbed or stolen in the eThekwini region,” he said. A 39-year-old man, of Cator Manor was arrested and appeared in the Durban Magistrates Court for possession of stolen motor vehicle. “The accused was found in possession of a Mercedes Benz that was taken in a house robbery at Chatsworth during December 2016. “A Toyota Fortuner which was stolen from the Durban Beachfront was recovered in Gauteng. These operations are ongoing and we can expect more arrest and recoveries,” said Zwane. POST
