Durban - The spices have been prepared and the frying pans are ready but the question on everyone's mind is... "Where are the sardines?" It seems the silvery little fish are evading the masses. According to the KZN Sharks Board, there has been an increase in sardine-related activity between Manteku and Mbotyi over the past few days but no reports closer to Durban waters "One of the dive operators in that area, Walter Bernardis, reported that they had seen birds and dolphins feeding over an area that covered about 10 rugby fields, which was amazing to watch. Most of this action took place last week Wednesday but it had dispersed by the next day. He did report that they thought this was the first pulse of sardines which had gone past towards KZN. There is a frontal system approaching, so hopefully this keeps pushing the fish north," said KZNSB Acting Head of Operations, Greg Thompson. He said there have also been reports of a definite increase in action in the Luphuthana Mouth area. This has led to an increase in dolphin activity. Thompson warned that most of the reporting and feedback received is inshore. "There is always a possibility of being surprised anywhere by fish which have moved through undetected in the deeper waters. These fish are very unpredictable and have always kept us all guessing about the movement. There are always numerous opinions but one seldom guesses right when it comes to sardines. Let’s hope that some of this activity arrives in KZN sometime this weekend," Thompson said. The Mercury
