Durban - As the trial of the three men accused of killing a retired principal is nearing the end, police have confirmed that a fourth suspect is still at large. Testifying in the Durban High Court Warrant Officer Norman Khomo, who was the State's last witness, said several attempts to track down the suspect were "fruitless." Khomo said the fourth suspect is only known as 'Tembinkosi' and police have no identikit of him. Intern estate agent Lungani Basil Underhill, 26, his cousin Braveman Underhill, 25, and Fredboy Msomi, 30, face charges of murder, attempted murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances following the death of Gona Pillay at her Silverglen home in September 2017. Her husband Loga sustained 17 stab wounds but survived the attack. He told the court that he watched helplessly as the men strangled his wife. The couple came under attack during a property viewing of their home which was on the market. Lungani was the first person to testify. An attempt to have a statement he made to police removed from evidence was unsuccessful. He claimed that police threatened and assaulted him and thus he made the statement. Acting Durban High Court JudgeÂ Naresh Bhikha found that is was not true and made the statement admissable. POST
