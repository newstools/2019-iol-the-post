Durban - Shoals of sardines have been spotted passing Port Edward, south of Durban,  but by midday on Tuesday, they had not been netted. According to the Sardine Run 2019 Facebook page, the biggest activity of sardines was between Southbroom and Port Edward along Glenmore Beach.    Frank Kahts said there were lots of sardine pockets near the beach. "Launched three boats at Glenmore but sardines moved deeper and moving fast. Our boats removed and loaded. We will move to Margate/Ramsgate."Kahts said. Phillip Lennon said,  "No netting has taken place in Glenmore on Tuesday. A massive shoal is moving past in a northerly direction about 1 to 2 km out to sea. We still hoping they do come in.  There was a huge shoal passing Leisure Bay. Still far out, around 2km. What is strange is that there is very little seabird and dolphin activity." Leonard Van Den Berg said he counted approximately 10 shoals moving north and about 1500m off shore. He said, "Birds and whales are very active around these areas." The distance between Durban and Glenmore Beach is 157 KM. Daily News
