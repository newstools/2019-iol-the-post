Durban - The world is my oyster and I never would have done anything to ruin my future. That's what intern estate agent Lungani Basil Underhill said during his testimony at the Durban High Court. Underhill, 26, pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, attempted murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances following the 2017 murder of retired principal Gona Pillay and the assault on her husband Loga. His co-accused Braveman Underhill, 25, and Fredboy Msomi, 30, are also expected to take the stand. Speaking about his career path, Underhill said he was employed at Pam Golding in Amanzimtoti since January 2017. "My dream was to become a professional property practitioner. Pam Golding Cape Town saw my talents and offered me a bursary to do my NQF 4. I never would have ruined my future.” Underhill further described Pillay as his mother. “After meeting her we got close and spoke on the phone many times both professionally and personally. She became more of a mother to me.” Underhill also told the court on the day of the incident, he hugged both Mr and Mrs Pillay and Mrs Pillay also offered him a kiss on the cheek. POST
