Durban - The funeral service of Phoenix “bloods gang” boss and tow-truck owner, Kalvin Perisamy is expected to take place on Saturday. The service is expected to take place at Perisamy’s home in Umhlanga thereafter proceeding to Pesco Hall in Sunford in Phoenix between 1pm and 4pm. The 30-year-old father of two, was shot dead in the parking lot at Gateway Theatre of Shopping on Thursday morning. It is believed he had been shot three times, once in the head, neck and throat while walking to his vehicle after leaving the gym. By Friday morning no one was arrested for the murder police said. Speculation is rife that the shooting was a hit on Periasamy following the death of another tow-truck driver earlier this year. Periasamy was expected to stand trial along with six co-accused along with his brother Kevin Periasamy and sister-in-law Desiree in July. They were arrested and detained after police recovered R80 000 worth of drugs and over R90 000 cash in their home in January 2018. He was currently out on a bail of R10 000, after he appealed against a bail decision for a separate murder charge in February. POST
