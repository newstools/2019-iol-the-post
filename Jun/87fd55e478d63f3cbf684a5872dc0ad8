Durban - A week after three people were killed in a home invasion in Richards Bay another resident is fighting for his life following a home invasion. The 58-year-old panel beater was allegedly shot eight times and is critical in hospital. KZN police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane it is alleged that the man was at his home in Buffalo Bend with his nephew when they were accosted by two unknown armed suspects. "At gunpoint the suspects took two television sets and fled the scene. The complainant alleged he later realised that his uncle was shot multiple times in his hand and leg. He was taken to hospital for medical attention." Zwane said cases of house robbery and attempted murder were opened at Richards Bay SAPS for investigation. A week ago homeowner Shaffey Kallow, 43, was shot in the head while his son Abu Bakr, 17, a Grade 11 pupil and their neighbour Basil Naidoo, 61, a retired procurement officer, were both shot in the chest during a robbery at their Arboretum gated complex in Richards Bay. All that was stolen was a handbag containing a cellphone. Three cases of murder were opened. Zwane added that no arrests had been made in both incidents. POST
