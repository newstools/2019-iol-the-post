Durban -Â Judgement in the Sadia Sukhraj murder trial is expected to be delivered in the Durban High Court later today. Sadia, 9, was killed in a botched hijacking in May 2018. Sibonelo Seni Mkhize, 39, of Savannah Park pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances charges. He is also accused of killing his accomplice. On May 28, 2018, Sadia had been on her way to school with her father Sukhraj, a pastor, when two armed men hijacked their vehicle with Sadia seated in the car. They had stopped at her maternal grandparent's home to drop off her then six-month-old brother Jaziel when the hijackers pounced. A shoot-out ensued and Sadia was shot. It was revealed during the trial that Shailendra had fired the fatal shot that killed his daughter. It further emerged that Sukhraj fired 15 rounds of ammunition. During closing arguments, State Prosecutor Kelvin Singh argued that the court should not punish the action but punish the intention. POST
