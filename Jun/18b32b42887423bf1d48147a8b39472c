On Tuesday Sadia's parents told the court in victim impact statements about the pain of losing their daughter a year old. Her father Shailedra said that Monday's judgement was a huge burden that has been lifted of their shoulders. "I know it will not replace or bring her (Sadia) back, but it is some consolation." Her mother Lorraine said it was only through God's grace that the family had made it thus far. Judge Steyn found the accused’s evidence to be evasive and inconsistent with the truth. In May 2018, Sadia died after she was shot in the chest during a botched hijacking when her father Shailendra Sukhraj,  stopped at her maternal grandparent's home in Shallcross with his wife Lorraine, to drop off her then six-month-old brother Jaziel. State prosecutor Kelvin Singh is asking for life imprisonent for the murder charge. POST
