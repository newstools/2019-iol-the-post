Durban - Gateway Theatre of Shopping hosted the annual Vodacom Durban July Preview Fashion Show on Saturday. Featuring the who's who of the industry, those at the show got to view eight race day pieces put together by designers hand-picked for the Vodacom Durban July Invited Designer Showcase. With the theme, "Stars of Africa, the nine designers involved took totally different approaches to their interpretations of the theme, providing fashion-lovers looking for creative ideas for their race day garments with plenty of inspiration. From traditional tribal shapes and pattern prints to dramatic modern Afrofuturistic looks, the crowd that packed around the runway at the Wavehouse was treated to a rollicking visual bonanza. The outfits will be presented onstage at The Lakes Lifestyle Village Action Stage shortly after 2pm on the day of the big event at Hollywoodbets Greyville.
