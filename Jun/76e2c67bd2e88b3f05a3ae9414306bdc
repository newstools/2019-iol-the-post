Durban - FlySafair said that all their passengers who were scheduled to fly from Durban to Johannesburg have reached their destination despite the airline having to cancel the flight due to an abandoned foetus being found on one of their aircraft. Speaking to IOL on Friday morning Kirby Gordon, Head of Sales and Distribution at FlySafair said the Flight FA 411 which was scheduled to depart Durban for Johannesburg at 06:15 am had been cancelled after the technical crew discovered what appeared to be an abandoned foetus within the system. "From my latest update, all passengers have reached their destination. We were able to accommodate passengers on different flights." Gordon thanked all the passengers for their patience and understanding and said they made every effort to ensure passengers were able to reach their destinations. "The passengers have been really great," concluded Gordon. He said the aircraft was still grounded. Police are still at the scene and have confirmed that a case of concealment of birth had been opened. A police source who is not authorised to speak to the media said the plane had landed from Johannesburg on Thursday night and had been parked overnight at the airport. The cleaning staff found a blockage in the lavatory and a suction had to be used POST
