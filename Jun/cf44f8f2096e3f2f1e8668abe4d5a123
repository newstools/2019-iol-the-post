Durban - The family of murdered Sadia Sukhraj have welcomed the guilty verdict handed down but has implored President Cyril Ramaphosa to do more to reduce the crime in our country. Reverend Cyril Pillay who is the family spokesperson said her parents Shailendra and Lorraine were heartbroken, traumatised, emotionally disturbed and in deep state of mourning following their only daughter's death. In a statement Pillay said the provoking circumstances surrounding the hijacking and the subsequent tragic fatality of an innocent young girl on May 28, 2018 was an unbearable emotional pain.   "We respect the judiciary system and thank the public for their passionate and ongoing endearments towards the bereaved family and subsequent community action to prevent any further tragic acts of violence. The hardened criminals created the tragic circumstances." Moments ago Durban High Court judge Judge Esther Steyn convicted Sibonelo Seni Mkhize, 39, to two counts of murder and armed robbery. Judge Steyn found that Mkhize acted in common purpose and the murders took place as a result of the robbery. She also found Mkhize's version to evasive and inconsistent with the truth. Sentencing is expected on Tuesday. POST
