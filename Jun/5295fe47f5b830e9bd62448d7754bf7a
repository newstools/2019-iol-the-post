Durban - A newborn baby was rescued from a pit toilet at a high school on the North Coast. According to East Coast Radio, the pupil, who was unaware she was pregnant - and in labour - gave birth to the baby in the pit toilet. The pupil apparently notified the school and emergency services where called to rescue the infant. Firefighters had to break through a slab under the toilet to save the baby. The teenager and her newborn baby are recovering in a KwaDukuza hospital. KZN Department of Education spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa said the incident has not been brought to the attention of KZN Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu as yet. Mthethwa said the incident was unfortunate and reiterated that the Department of Education had procedures in place for pupils who found themselves pregnant. "In consultation with parents and teachers, arrangements can be made for pupils to catch up on their school work closer to their delivery dates." Mthethwa said that while the department did not promote or encouraged pupils to get pregnant, they were not punitive and believed in second chances. POST
