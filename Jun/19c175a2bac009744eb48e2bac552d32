"I was notified that at least 1 person was still trapped in the room. Several attempts were made to gain access to the room to rescue the individual unsuccessfully due to the flames and smoke. "Once the fire was extinguished a sweep of the home was conducted by the fire department, sadly an individual identified as Keegan Reddy from Warrappen Keegan succumbed as a result." Sadack said funeral details had not been confirmed and family were awaiting the post-mortem. Reddy became famous in 2016 after a video of a fight between a group of friends at a braai went viral on social media. The video showed Keegan assaulting one of his friends when another friends interjected saying, "Warrapen relax..we all braz, warrapen Keegan." Another friend who seemed to have been filming the altercation, stood on a fire and burnt his shoes. "My shoes got burnt, I didn't even realise I was standing on the fire." The video soon began an online sensation and a popular catch phrase among Durban locals. KZN police said a case had been opened. POST
