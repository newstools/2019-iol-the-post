Durban - The Department of Education has condemned the shooting at a school in Folweni that claimed the life of a teacher. KZN Department of Education spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa described the attack as "barbaric". "Schools should be a safe environment. No one should use schools as a soft target." An hour ago a 48 year old teacher had been walking in the school passageway when he was gunned down by an unknown male. According to Netcare 911 multiple shots were fired and the teacher was shot in the head and abdomen. "Unfortunately his injuries were too severe and he was declared dead on scene," said Herbst. Mthethwa said: "We are calling upon police to move swiftly in apprehending the perpetrator." He added that no other injuries had been reported but the crime scene was still active. "We have sent department officials to the scene to establish what transpired." SAPS were on scene. POST
