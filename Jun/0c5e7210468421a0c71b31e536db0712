The City’s water and sanitation department has ignored their concerns. “My emails bounce from one person to another person,” said one of the petition’s signatories, Glen Naidoo of Citrine Road. “Raw sewage runs outside our homes and it flows down the road and ends up in the stormwater drain. Living here is a nightmare.” In Pond Turn, Welbedacht, residents complained of a clogged sewer pipe, which resulted in faeces flowing near their homes. Lolly Soobramoney, 55, said the stench made it difficult for her to digest a meal. She said she had been calling for assistance but nothing happens. The City did not respond to requests for comment at the time of publication. POST
