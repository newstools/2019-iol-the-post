Durban - The man accused of the killing Durban escort Siam Lee has died. Philani Ntuli, 30, who was smooth talking in court during his dragged out bail appearance, reportedly died on Friday morning, private investigator Brad Nathanson confirmed. Ntuli had been diagnosed with skin cancer and was undergoing treatment. In his last appearance in the Durban High Court on May 15, the Durban businessman had hobbled into the dock on crutches. Lee was abducted in January last year from a Durban North house believed to be a brothel. Two days later her charred body was found in a sugarcane field in New Hanover. Nathanson, who arrested Ntuli at his Assagay home and was scheduled to be a witness in his trial, posted on Facebook: "Philani Gift Ntuli is dead. At least now, Ntuli will not be able to hurt any more women."  Sue Foster, a friend of Lee's mother Nan, said death was "an easy way out" for Ntuli. "What Nan and I wanted was that he be held accountable for all the girls he had hurt. But at least he cannot hurt any more." Nan Lee could not be reached for comment.
