Durban - A mother Humpback whale and her calf were rescued by members of the SA Whale Disentanglement Network on Monday. Craig Lambinon of the National Sea Rescue Institute said eyewitnesses had reported that the large female and her calf were entangled in fishing rope and two bouys off shore of Seabreeze, in the direction of St Francis Bay. "Two NSRI Port Elizabeth sea rescue crafts, accompanied by SAWDN volunteers and a SAWDN volunteers whale watching boat, responded and upon arrival found the whale moving swiftly at about five knots and entangled in two wraps of fishing rope around her body. She was trailing fishing rope attached to two floatation buoys," he said. Lambinon said an NSRI St Francis Bay sea rescue craft accompanied by SAWDN volunteers, had also launched to respond after the two whales were found to be heading swiftly towards St Francis Bay and the Port Elizabeth.
