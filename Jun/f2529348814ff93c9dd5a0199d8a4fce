Mohapi was arrested over the weekend on the N2 near Mandeni and detained at the Gingindlovu SAPS. His case has been adjourned to a later date Govender said. KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, Mxolisi Kaunda has commended the Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) for the arrest. “Earlier this year, we issued a clear directive to our law enforcement officers to clamp down on speeding, as well as drinking and driving. So far, I am pleased that our operations are yielding positive results,” said Kaunda. He said the latest arrest will send a strong message to other road users that that KwaZulu-Natal is a zero tolerance province. “Anyone who breaks the law in this province will spend time in jail. Therefore let us all abide by the rules of the road so that we can save lives,” said Kaunda. POST
