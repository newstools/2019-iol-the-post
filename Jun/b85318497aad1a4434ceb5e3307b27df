Durban - A serial rapist has been jailed for 292 years. Mhlonipheni Mjadu, 25, received seven terms of life imprisonment for seven counts of rape. He was convicted on 19 counts for crimes he committed from 2013 to 2016 in Ndaye, Esikhaleni. In addition to the life sentences Mjadu received 75 years imprisonment for five counts of robbery, 30 years imprisonment  for six counts of housebreaking and 12 years imprisonment for attempted rape. Mjadu is accused of terrorising the community of Esikhaleni since 2013. "He would forcefully enter the victim’s homes and attack them. He threatened his victims with a firearm before he raped and robbed them," said police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane "During January 2016, a police constable was allegedly robbed of his firearm at Esikhaleni. He managed to overpower the suspect and arrested him. During the course of the investigation the accused was linked through DNA analysis to 19 other crimes committed at Esikhaleni as from 2013. The arrest brought his crime spree to an end and prevented him from terrorising the Esikhaleni community further," conclude Zwane. POST
