Durban -  The case of a Verulam mother accused of dumping her newborn baby in a black garbage bag has been adjourned for outstanding pre-sentencing reports. The woman who cannot be named to protect the identity of her children, appeared briefly at the Verulam Regional Court on Tuesday before the case was postponed to June 26. The 31-year-old was convicted of attempted murder after pleading guilty in April. In the plea she admitted that she fell pregnant while in a relationship of 18 years. After informing her partner, he allegedly ended things with her, saying he was not prepared to support the baby. She said she continued with the pregnancy but did not seek medical assessments. Close to reaching full term she alleged the baby had stopped moving. On January 14, she went into labour at her home in Everest Heights and became alarmed at the amount of blood and placenta. She then had a bath and proceeded to wrap the child up and place it in a black refuse bag. She then placed the bag on the roadside. The unemployed woman who has two other children, was arrested after the 2.3kg baby was found abandoned on Olivine Road, metres away from her home. Her bail of R1000 was extended. POST
