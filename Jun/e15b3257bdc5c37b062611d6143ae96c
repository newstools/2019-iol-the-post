Durban - IT HAS been five days since businesswoman Sandra Moonsamy's kidnapping and her whereabouts remains unknown. Moonsamy, 45, was abducted after the black SUV she was driving was blocked by two vehicles near the M13 and Stapleton Road in Pinetown. A spokesperson for the Hawks Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said investigations were ongoing and she had not been located. Her brother Inderan Naicker, said they are continuing to pray for her safety and well-being and hope that she will be returned to her children soon. "We will be offering a reward to anyone who comes forward with information that results in us locating her." According to reports in the Sunday Tribune Moonsamy attempted to lock herself in her vehicle but her assailants fired two shots through one of the side windows before she was dragged out and forced into a car. Her vehicle was found abandoned with a cellphone and some of her possessions. At the weekend, a signal from her second cellphone was located in the North and South beach area. POST
