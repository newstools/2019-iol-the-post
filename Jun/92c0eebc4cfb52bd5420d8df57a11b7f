Durban - Convicted killer Rajivee Soni will remain behind bars until his appeal is heard in the Supreme Court of Appeal. Earlier on Tuesday Durban High Court Judge Jacqueline Henriques dismissed Soni's leave to appeal his refusal of bail in April. She found that there was no reasonable prospects another court would come to a different conclusion. In his appeal Soni said his reasons for wanting bail included the well-being of his children, his duty as a primary caregiver and his health. They also stated that Soni was a first time offender who never missed trial even when out on bail. The Pietermaritzburg businessman was jailed to 30 years for the 2013 murder of Pietermaritzburg doctor Bhavish Sewram. Sewram, a father of two, was shot outside his surgery in Raisethorpe. Soni believed that his wife, Kerusha, and Sewram were involved in a romantic relationship. He enlisted the help of former policeman Brian Treasurer. Treasurer, who was serving a life sentence died in prison. On September 19, the Pietermaritzburg High Court found Soni guilty on six charges including murder and conspiracy to commit murder. He began serving his prison sentence in October at the New Hanover Prison. In April the court ruled in Soni's favour and he was granted leave to appeal his sentence and conviction. The appeal could be probably be heard in March / April 2020. POST
