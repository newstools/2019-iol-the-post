Durban - One of the accused standing trial for the murder of retired principal Gona Pillay said he was just the driver and had no intention of killing her. Taking the stand in the month-long trial in the Durban High Court this week Fredboy Msomi, 30, said he was providing transport to co-accused intern estate agent Lungani Basil Underhill, 25, and Braveman Underhill, 25. on the day of the murder on September 21, 2017. He denied that he was the mastermind as his two co-accused are alleging. Pillay was strangled to death in the presence of her husband during a house viewing of their 7-bedroom SIlverglen home which was on the market. Her husband Loga, 71, was stabbed several times. He survived the attack. Their attackers made of with their Mercedes Benz and television. Msomi has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, attempted murder and armed robbery. In his testimony Msomi said: “I was advised that accused one (Basil) was a real estate agent and did not have a vehicle to move around to see his clients. I agreed to transport him for a fee.” Msomi said he played no role in the killing or robbery. Arguments are expected to take place. Judgement is expected next week. POST
