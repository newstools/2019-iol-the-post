Durban - A Verulam mother who admitted she knew her baby was alive when she dumped him in the bin is due to be sentenced in the Verulam Magistrate's Court today. In her guilty plea handed to the court on April 16, the 31-year-old said she expected the baby to be removed by the waste services when she did it. The woman, who has two minor children, said she became depressed when she told her boyfriend that she was pregnant and he refused to support her. "My partner informed me that he was not interested in continuing with our relationship. He elected no to support me in my pregnancy and he severed our relationship." She told the court that she did not seek any prenatal care for her pregnancy. On January 14 the woman said she gave birth at her home without medical intervention and placed the child in a refuse bag and placed the bag along the road. She was arrested by Reaction Unit SA shortly thereafter. The court heard that the child was in the care of his father. POST
