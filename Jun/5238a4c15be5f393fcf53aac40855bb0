Durban - A newborn baby with its umbilical cord still attached has been found abandoned in Caneside Phoenix. According to Gareth Naidoo, spokesperson for KZN VIP, they were called out to the scene by members of the community who heard a baby crying. "On arrival we found the newborn baby girl wrapped in clothing. Paramedics attended to the newborn before rushing the baby to Mahatma Gandhi Hospital. Naidoo said the baby was placed on the grass under a tree. He said residents were very upset that the child was abandoned. "They were happy that the child survived." He said SAPS were on scene which was still active. Earlier this month a 21 year old was arrested for allegedly abandoning her newborn at Engen garage at uShaka, Point. Police said the two week old baby was immediately taken to a nearby hospital for medical attention. In a separate incident a Newlands East mother who threw her baby into a stormwater drain earlier this year is also facing trial. She is out on bail. POST
