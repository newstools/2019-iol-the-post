Durban - The KZN MEC for Education Kwazi Mshengu is expected to head to Phoenix on Friday to address a number of issues plaguing certain schools in the area like drug abuse and school violence. In a statement sent out by the Department of Education the MEC is expected to meet with the school governing bodies of the 12 affected schools on Friday morning at Hopeville Primary School in Phoenix. The challenges that have been raised by the very SGBs are posts fixing; financial management; governance issues; drug abuse; school violence; bullying; poor school management; malpractices; and poor management of schools. In December the Sunday Tribune reported that the governing body of Hopeville Primary School in Phoenix was calling for an independent audit of the school’s bank account after it alleged there were irregularities in transactions from the account. They claimed principals and circuit managers from surrounding areas, have been using the account for their personal interests. POST
