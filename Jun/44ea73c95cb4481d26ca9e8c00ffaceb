Durban - Two people have been arrested and charged for the murder of a Reaction Unit SA officer. Mduduzo Makhanya, 28, was fatally stabbed after he allegedly intervened in an argument between a property owner and two of her tenants at her home in Everest Heights Verulam on May 18. "We can confirm two suspects aged 22 were arrested for murder. They appeared in the Verulam Magistrate's Court and the case was remanded to June 5," said KZN police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala. According to RUSA boss Prem Balram the elderly woman was attempting to evict the two men who lived on her property when they started to threaten her and her grandson. "Mduduzo lived next to the elderly woman and went to her assistance when he heard the argument. One of the men drew a pocket knife and stabbed the RUSA Officer in the neck, chest and stomach.
