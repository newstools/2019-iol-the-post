Durban - The defence attorney of Phoenix triple murder accused Colin Pillay said her client would say that he found a knife on the side of the road and disposed of it. Legal Aid attorney Amanda Hulley was responding to CCTV footage that apparently showed Pillay on the day of the murders walking on Longcroft Drive, disgarding a knife. Pillay has pleaded not guilty to the murders of Phoenix mother Jane Govindsamy and her daughters Nikita and Denisha on September 2018. His defence was that he had been gambling and fishing. He was arrested two days after the murder at Camps Lodge by Warrant officer Bob Pillay of Provincial Organised Crime. Their bodies were found by their father Sgaren Govindsamy who was the first person to testify at the start of the trial on Monday. Testifying in the Durban High Court on Tuesday Sergeant Rajen Saunders testifiedÂ about what he saw on CCTV footage obtained from a boutique in Longcroft which clearly shows Pillay wiping and discarding a silver object on the roadside. The boutique is 100 metres away from the victim's home. The court heard that Saunders left the boutique and walked 10 meters to the spot where the object was discarded where he found a knife with a black handle. Pillay's girlfriend Wendy Moodley confirmed to the court that it was Pillay in the CCTV footage as she had seen him on that day and he was wearing the same outfit. The trial is proceeding. POST
