Durbn - The man who was allegedly found in possession of kidnapped businesswoman Sandra Moonsamy's cellphone has made his fourth appearance in the Durban Magistrate's Court. Jerry Ogbuwany Gike, 35,  hairdressing salon owner was arrested at the beginning of the month in the Point area and charged with theft. Gike is expected to make a formal bail application next week. He made a brief appearance today and was remanded back into police custody. The State intends opposing his bail. Gike's arrest was the first breakthrough in Moonsamy's kidnapping on May 30. The financial director at her family-owned business, Crossmoor Transport, Moonsamy was allegedly taken by gunmen near the M13 and Stapleton Road intersection, in Pinetown. It is believed her kidnappers are demanding R150 million in exchange for her safe return. Moonsamy's brother, Inderan Naicker, said: “While every passing day makes the burden on our family heavier, we remain optimistic that she will be returned to us safely. POST
