Durban - KZN police have issued a warning to people to refrain from spreading false news on social before verifying it. This comes after a driver for an NGO was chased to the Umhlali police stations by locals who believed he was trying to kidnap kids. "The driver of the NGO had stopped his car because he had been warning the kids not to throw stones. People thought he was going to kidnap the boys," saidÂ Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane. He further confirmed that the police had not received any complaint of a missing person or child who was kidnapped by this vehicle. "We are appealing to the members of the community not to spread fake news. They must verify the information with the police first before they can circulate," said Zwane. He concluded if there are those who were really affected, they must report such to the police. POST
