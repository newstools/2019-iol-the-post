We have not received a report on the number of drug dens closed to date. IÂ  handed over the list to the MEC for Community Safety, Mxolisi Kaunda to act promptly and close these dens with immediate effect. The DA will continue to act in the interests of the community and will revert as soon as a response is received," Hoosen said. Daily News
