Durban - A domestic worker is in a critical condition after she was mauled by a Rottweiler in Isipingo. According to Devan Govindasamy, the tactical response manager from PT Alarms, they were called out to Lotus Park earlier this morning. "It appears the domestic worker had arrived at her work place. According to information received she had been working at the home for 11 years and the dog was known to her. "She had been entering the premises and the dog had tried to escape the gate. It seems when she closed the gate the dog mauled her. "It was a very gruesome attack. The victim was severely bitten on the head, both arms and neck." Govindasamy said the owners were present and the victim was rushed to Isipingo Hospital. On Monday a teenager sustained critical injuries after she was mauled by pitbulls on Stanley Copley Road in Overport. One of the pitbulls were shot dead following the attack. POST
