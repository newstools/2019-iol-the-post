Durban - The man charged with killing three people in the 'Phoenix triple murder' case refused the services of a legal aid attorney, but it now seems he has no other choice, as his family have no money to appoint a private attorney. At the Durban High Court on Tuesday during the pre-trial conference of triple murder accused Colin Pillay, it was placed on record that his family cannot afford a private attorney. Pillay has been charged for the murders of Jane Govindsamy, 45, and her daughters Denisha, 22, and Nikita, 16. They were all killed on September 20 last year, in Phoenix. He also faces a charge of theft. At his last appearance, Durban attorney Chris Gounden withdrew his representation citing a conflict of interest as a reason. However, Pillay declined the services of a legal aid attorney and told the court that his family will help arrange for the services of a private attorney. Pillay's trial is expected to take place at the Durban High Court from July 29 until August 8. According to the indictments, the accused, who is an unmarried tow truck driver, was involved in an extra marital affair with Jane and visited her home among other places when her husband Sagren was at work or gone out. It was further alleged that the accused began to suspect that Jane was involved in another extramarital relationship with someone else and was allegedly unable to accept this and decided to kill her.
