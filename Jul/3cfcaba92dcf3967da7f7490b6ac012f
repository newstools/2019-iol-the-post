The Grade 7 pupils, from Palmview Primary School in Phoenix, are receiving trauma counselling following the incident. Vinod Rooplal, a parent who oversees the training, said his son, Vivek, and 13 classmates were at the ground. “On Saturday morning, I left them at the ground, while I went home to fetch the soccer equipment. “During this time, the suspect grabbed their bags that contained their branded takkies, and cellphones. When they tried to stop him, he threatened to stab them and fled. I returned to find the boys badly shaken. We are looking at using an indoor facility to continue practising.” A school employee said: “The ground is used by the public and is dangerous for pupils, especially when they are not supervised by adults.” Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala encouraged the parents to open a case.
