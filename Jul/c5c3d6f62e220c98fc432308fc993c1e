Durban - A teenager is in a serious condition after she was attacked by two pitbulls while walking on Stanley Copley Road near Crocus Road in Sydenham on Monday afternoon. According to Garrith Jamieson from Rescue Care Paramedics they arrived on scene to find the seriously injured teenager laying on grass. "Advanced Life Support Paramedics worked to stabilise the girl on the scene who had sustained serious injuries. "It is believed the two pit bulls somehow escaped from a nearby residence when they attacked the girl. "A SAPS office driving past witnessed the incident stopped and assisted until medics arrived on the scene. "The one dog was shot on the scene and collapsed and died a short way up from the scene while the second one ran away. Once stabilised the girl was rushed to a nearby hospital by ambulance for the urgent care she required," said Jamieson. SAPS were on the scene and will be investigating further. POST
