Durban - Asphalting of the road surface is underway on the damaged portion of Chatsworth's Higginson Highway Durban bound between Moorton and Croftdene on Monday. Tony Govender, an eThekwini ward 70 eThekwini Councillor said the road could be opened to traffic on Thursday. Residents of Chatsworth and surrounding suburbs that use the Higginson Highway will breathe a sigh of relief because the road repairs are almost complete. In April, an underground storm water culvert  which travels from the Chatsworth Stadium, under the Higginson Highway, then towards the Bottlebrush Informal settlement was damaged. This resulted in the road surface collapsing above it. Govender said engineers had back-filled the road to its level and very little work needs to be done besides the pedestrian guard rails. EThekwini municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela explained that the culvert under the highway had structural failure. "Structural work on the culvert was undertaken. A few informal settlements that are on the road verge were relocated. The estimated costs of the repairs is R6.5 million,"Mayisela said. Since April, motorists had to use alternative routes through the Chatsworth suburb to bypass the damaged section between Moorton and Croftdene. The road also services the suburbs of Shallcross, Klaarwater, Demat, St Wendolins Ridge, Mariannridge,Nagina and KwaNdengezi. The road surface collapsed near Link Road bridge forcing authorities to close the arterial route to Durban. Daily News
