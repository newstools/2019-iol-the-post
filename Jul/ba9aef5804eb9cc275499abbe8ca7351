Durban - The Department of Health has confirmed they have received correspondence regarding the R7 million damages claim from the family of a patient at RK Khan Hospital who was found with thousands of maggots in his mouth. Spokesperson for the KZN Department of Health Ncumisa Mafunda said: “The Department has received formal correspondence regarding this matter, and has referred it to its Legal Services unit, who dealing with it accordingly.” A video of 52-year-old Sadek Ebrahim with thousands of maggots in his mouth caused outrage on social media. On Tuesday Durban attorney Theasan Pillay from Theasan Pillay & Associates confirmed they were acting on behalf of the Ebrahim family. In a letter addressed to the new CEO of RK Khan Hospital Nqobile Mkhwanazi they claim that the maggots had resulted from the deceased not being treated properly nor kept in a hygienic environment. The family claimed that they suffered undue emotional trauma, anxiety and distress and continue to suffer. The claim is R2 million for Ebrahim's wife and R5 million for his son. They have given the Department 30 days to pay. Facebook users commented: Fathima Rassack: Felt awful for the poor man,the image haunts me too. But now I wonder what the purpose of publicity was for? I can't judge their intentions but R7 million is too much. Maybe pay for the wife's well being and use the rest under the supervision of a trusted person and upgrade and improve services. Charlene Naicker Pillay: This is a good wake up call.for the health dept.Give nursing training to people with a passion. Leona Govender: Good hygiene starts at home with your family, maggots don't suddenly appear in hospital, it all stems from poor long term hygiene. 7illion can be used for the upgrade of the hospital and facilities on a whole.
