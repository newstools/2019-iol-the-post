Durban - Pupils and staff at a school in uMlazi's L Section had to be rushed to hospital on Monday morning following a suspected toxic gas leak. Rescue Care spokesperson, Garrith Jamieson, said they were called to the scene just after 9:30am and found chaos at the school. "It is alleged that some pupils were playing with a ball of some kind which then tore open and a powder substance spilled. This substance was then picked up by the wind and entered multiple classrooms effecting multiple pupils and teachers," he said. Jamieson said EMRS and Rescue Care paramedics called for more resources to assist due to the number of injuries. "The SAPS and Metro Police Search and Rescue unit were also called to assist. Three pupils and a teacher had sustained critical injuries and were stabilised on the scene. The Lenmed1 Aeromedical Helicopter was called in to assist for rapid transportation to the Lenmed Ethekweni Hospital and Heart Centre," Jamieson said.
