Durban - Eights years after two employees defrauded an FET College they have been jailed for three years. This week the Durban Specialised Commercial Crime Court convicted Mphilisi Claude Mkhize, 45, a procurement officer and Tholakele Gracia Nzimande, 51, a lecturer to 12 counts of fraud. According to KZN Hawks spokesperson, Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo, the pair had been employed at the Mnambithi FET college. He said in 2013, two years after the fraud, the college had appointed a forensic company to investigate irregularities in the procurement of goods and services. "This was after allegations of corruption were levelled against the convicted pair," said Mhlongo. He said investigations revealed that in 2011, the pair conspired and manipulated the tender processes of the college. "A tender for supply and removal of waste containers at the campus was unduly awarded to Mkhize despite the fact that no services were rendered." He said the college suffered losses of up to R273 756,00 as a result of wasteful and fruitless expenditure. A case of fraud was reported at Ladysmith Police Station and the case docket was allocated to the Hawks’ members from the Pietermaritzburg Serious Commercial Crime unit for further investigation. The two were arrested in May 2015 and appeared in court several times until their sentencing. POST
