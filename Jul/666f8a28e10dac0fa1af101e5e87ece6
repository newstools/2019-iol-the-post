Durban - The trial of triple murder accused Colin Pillay is expected to begin in the Durban High Court on Monday morning. Pillay, 46, has been charged with three counts of murder and theft following the brutal murders of Jane Govindsamy, 45, a receptionist, her daughters Denisha, 22, and Nikita, 16, a Grade 11 pupil at Rydal Park Secondary on September 20, 2018. The trial has been set down until August 8 and Pillay will be represented by a legal aid attorney.  According to the indictments, Pillay claims  that he had been involved in an extramarital affair with Jane since 2009. He suspected that she (Jane) was involved in another extramarital relationship with someone else and was allegedly unable to accept this. He subsequently decided to kill her. The accused is alleged to have stolen R1 850 in cash, 3 Samsung cellular phones, and an LG television set and fled the scene. Pillay was arrested shortly after the murder by Warrant Officer Bob Pillay from the Provincial Organised Crime Unit. According to post mortem results, Govindsamy and Nikita died as a result of consistent neck compression. Denisha died of multiple penetrating wounds to the neck. POST
