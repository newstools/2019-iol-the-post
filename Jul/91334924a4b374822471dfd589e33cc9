Ntuli, 30, is believed to have died of skin cancer last month. NPA spokesperson Natasha Kara confirmed that they had asked the South African Police Service to verify Ntuli’s death. Ntuli was due to appear in court on July 29 for a pre-trial conference. Kara said the matter would remain on the roll until then, but in the event of the accused’s death being confirmed, the matter would be struck off the roll. Last month, Ntuli’s lawyer, Reial Mahabeer, said that he had been informed that Ntuli had died. At the time of his death, he had been out on R40 000 bail. He was accused of kidnapping Lee from outside her work place in Durban North in January last year. Following an extensive search that spanned the province, Lee’s charred body was found in a sugarcane field in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. Ntuli was arrested after he was linked to the vehicle used to kidnap Lee. He faced a raft of charges relating to Lee’s murder as well as other charges related to his former fiancée. The Mercury
