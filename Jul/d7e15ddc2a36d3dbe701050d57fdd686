Durban - The three men accused of murdering former principal Gona Pillay in her Silverglen home in 2017 received life sentences in the Durban High Court moments ago. Pam Golding intern estate agent Basil Underhill, Braveman Underhill and Fredboy Msomi also received 13 years for the robbery with aggravating circumstances. Msomi received a further five years for the theft charge. All sentences will run concurrently. Acting Judge Naresh Bhika said Basil was in fact the mastermind and that the three acted in common purpose. During the sentencing proceedings Acting Judge Bhika said that one cannot even explain the brutality of the murder and that there were no substantial or compelling circumstances to force him to deviate from the minimum sentence Pilllay and her husband Loga came under attack during a property viewing of their home which had been on the market. The couple had planned to move into a seaside apartment in Amanzimtoti. POST
