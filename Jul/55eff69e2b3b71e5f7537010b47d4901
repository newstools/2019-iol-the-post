Durban - UKZN's Risk Management Services and Public Order Policing are currently monitoring the protest action that has erupted at their Westville campus today. Ashton Bodrick, Executive Director Corporate Relations at UKZN confirmed that students on the Westville Campus are engaged in protest action. "There have been attempts to block roads and disrupt lectures. Management will engage student leadership to resolve concerns and issues raised by students.  We are committed to restoring peace and stability on Campus and ensuring that teaching and learning takes place as scheduled," said Bodrick. The tertiary institution has been plagued with on-going protests this year and classes have been disrupted. In March groups of students set property alight over issues that included wi-fi access at off-campus residences and funding for postgraduate studies. The Daily News reported that the structural damage costs ran into almost R3,5 million. This year Durban University of Technology student Mlungisi Madonsela was shot at the institution during a protest. POST
