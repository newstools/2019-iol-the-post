Durban - The man allegedly found in possession of a phone belonging to Crossmoor Transport Plant employee, Sandra Moonsamy, made a brief appearance in court on Friday. Jerry Ogbuwany Gike, 35, who has been charged with theft, appeared at the Durban Magistrate's Court for bail. The matter was adjourned to verify his legal status in the country. He is expected to appear again next week. It is over 40 days since the Westville mother of two went missing. Moonsamy, 45, the financial director at her family-owned business, was allegedly taken by gunmen near the M13 and Stapleton Road intersection in Pinetown. Gike, a hairdressing salon owner, operating on Mahatma Gandhi Road, was arrested on July 4. He was found in possession of a rose gold iPhone 7plus cellphone allegedly belonging to Moonsamy. This is the first breakthrough in the case since her disappearance on May 30. He made a brief appearance last week and was remanded into police custody. Days after Moonsamy was kidnapped, police and a private investigator traced her cellphone signal to the North Beach area. However, the phone was switched off before the police could pinpoint the exact location. The Post
