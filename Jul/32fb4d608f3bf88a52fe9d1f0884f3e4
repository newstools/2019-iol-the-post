Durban - Two Phoenix teenagers have been jailed for the brutal murder of 64 year old Joshua Pillay. Ashley Veerasamy, 19, of Stonepark, has been found guilty of bludgeoning Pillay to death with a spade in November 2017 and stealing valuables. This week he was jailed to 18 years for the murder and 10 years for robbery with aggravating circumstances. His co-accused Abigail Pillay, 19, was found guilty only on the robbery charge and was jailed to 10 years. Pillay, a father-of-three was stabbed and bludgeoned with a spade in his Palmview, Phoenix, home.  He died in hospital a few days later. The duo had stolen a laptop and cellphone from his home. In handing down sentence, Magistrate Nokwazi Sosibo said the accused did not display any remorse. “Although the court does not have any evidence of remorse, because of the youthfulness of the accused, there is a high probability that they are capable of rehabilitation. “They are still capable of being molded on how to act, to behave and to be integrated  into society. The court also has to be cautious not to throw away the key, if there is a great probability of rehabilitation,” she said. The duo who were in prison custody, will serve their sentence at Westville Prison. POST
