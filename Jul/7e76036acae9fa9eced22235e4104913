Durban - THE family of a Park Rynie man who went missing four days ago have appealed for anyone with information to come forward. Ashaylin Govender,26, was last seen at Rocky Bay beach, on the KZN South Coast on Friday night. Govender’s brother, Rishalan said he last spoke to his brother on Friday and his cellphone had since been turned off. “All we know right now is that he had finished work at around 11am and had gone to the beach with a group of friends. We were told that about 7pm, he had apparently left his car keys in his car and just walked away without telling anyone where he was going and did not return. “We went out on a search with the police at the weekend but there were no traces of him. We are really concerned because as far as we know he wasn’t facing any problems that would make him just want to up and leave without telling anyone,” he said. KZN police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed a missing person docket is being investigated by Scottburgh SAPS. “The missing person is still being sought by police. We appeal to anyone with information on his whereabouts to contact Scottburgh SAPS on 039 978 9954/1900 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111.” POST
