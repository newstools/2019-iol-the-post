Durban - The man charged for allegedly being in possession of missing businesswoman's Sandra Moonsamy's cellphone is expected to appear in the Durban Magistrate's Court. Jerry Ogbuwany Gike, 35, a hairdressing salon owner, has been charged for theft. Gike will appear in the Durban Magistrate's Court. Moonsamy has been missing for more than five weeks. The financial director at her family-owned business, Crossmoor Transport, Moonsamy was allegedly taken by gunmen near the M13 and Stapleton Road intersection, in Pinetown. It is believed her kidnappers are demanding R150 million in exchange for her safe return. Gike was arrested a week ago on Mahatma Gandhi Road. He was found in possession of a cellphone allegedly belonging to Moonsamy. This is the first breakthrough in the case since her disappearance on May 30. Moonsamy's brother, Inderan Naicker, said: “While every passing day makes the burden on our family heavier, we remain optimistic that she will be returned to us safely. POST
