Durban - Acting Judge Naresh Bhika found that the three men who killed a retired principal in her home showed no remorse. Moments ago Pam Golding intern estate agent Basil Underhill, Braveman Underhill and Fredboy Msomi received life sentences for the murder of Gona Pilllay in September 2017. In passing sentence Acting Judge Bhika said it was clear that Basil Underhill and Msomi were not remorseful. "There is a fine line between regret and remorse.It is clear in this case regret takes dominance over remorse," the judge said. The three men looked unfazed as they heard their fate. On Tuesday shortly after being convicted for the murder Basil Underhill blew a kiss in court as he exited the dock. He denied being involved in the murder, even though the court found him to be the mastermind. The judge described Pillay's death as brutal and senseless. Loga who attended court sessions with his family called for life sentences for his wife's killers. Sentencing proceedings are still underway. POST
