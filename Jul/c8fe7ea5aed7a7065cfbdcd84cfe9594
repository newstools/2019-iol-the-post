Durban - Judgment is expected to be handed down at the Durban High Court on Thursday for three men accused of murdering a retired school principal at her Chatsworth home. Intern estate agent Lungani Basil Underhill, 26, his cousin Braveman Underhill, 25, and Fredboy Msomi, 30, face charges of murder, attempted murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances following the death of Gona Pillay, 63, at her Silverglen home in September 2017. Her husband Loga, 71, sustained 17 stab wounds but survived the attack. The couple came under attack during a property viewing of their Silverglen home. At the start of trial in June, Loga told the court that he watched helplessly as the men strangled his wife. During trial, Basil, who was employed by Pam Golding Properties told the court he believed he had been used by Msomi to gain access into the couples' home. “I deny being involved in this crime… I was beguiled and deceived by accused two (Msomi) who purported to purchase Mrs Pillays property.” However, during his testimony, Msomi said Basil was the mastermind and he was just providing transport to the cousins. A fourth suspect, known only as Thembinkosi is still at large. POST
