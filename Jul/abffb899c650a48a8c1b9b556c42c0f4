Durban - Workers at the Ngqura Container Terminal have been ordered to increase performance levels at the port. This comes after Transnet was able to secure a court interdict against several employees who have embarked on a go-slow for the last two weeks. Transnet spokesperson, Molatwane Likhethe, said the the interdict was obtained to stop the illegal strike action by employees at the terminal. "The order by the Labour Court in Port Elizabeth was issued to all operations employees at Ngqura Container Terminal," he said. According to Likhethe, operations have been disrupted by malicious radio interference. Since the suspension of 11 employees last week, radio interference has stopped and operational performance has improved. Transnet acting group CEO, Mohammed Mahomedy, said they are working around the clock to find solutions, including prioritising urgent cargo. "We are also continuing to refine our contingency plans in order to minimise the impactÂ to the economy," he said. It is alleged that workers were on a go-slow due to a dispute over the payment of bonuses. The Mercury
