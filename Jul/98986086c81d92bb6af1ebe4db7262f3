Durban - The Newlands East mother who allegedly dumped her newborn baby in a stormwater drain in February this year made a brief appearance in theNtuzuma Magistrate’s Court earlier today. The matter was adjourned to August 13 for representations to be made to the senior public prosecutor. The 32-year-old, mother of two, face charges of attempted murder and is currently out on R5000 bail. The four hour rescue of the newborn babygirl went viral on social media. It was members of the community who raised the alarm bells after they heard a baby crying in a stormwater drain in Barracuda Road and Herring Circle in Newlands East. Emergency workers had to dig a trench to save the infant who was airlifted to hospital. The woman handed herself over to police a few days later. Shortly after the arrest the child's biological father and his wife came forward saying that he lied to the child's mother that he was unmarried and that she had lied she had a miscarriage. His wife told IOL that she was prepared to raise the child as her own. POST
