Pam Golding intern estate agent Basil Underhill, his cousin Braveman Underhill and Fredboy Msomi were convicted of murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances. Msomi was convicted of theft. Pillay, a retired principal at Southlands Secondary and her husband Loga came under attack at their Silverglen home in September 2017. Their 7-bedroom home had been on the market as the couple planned to move to a seaside apartment in Amanzimtoti. They were attacked during a property viewing of their home. Loga was stabbed several times but lived to tell the tale. He told the court how he watched helplessly as his wife was strangled in front of him. Some of the couple's belongings including their vehicle had been stolen. In delivering his judgment Acting Judge Naresh Bhika said Basil was in fact the mastermind and that the three acted in common purpose. Acting Judge Bhika described Pillay's death as "senseless." POST
