Durban - Land invaders have threatened to burn the homes of Bonela residents in Cato Manor if the eThekwini Land Invasion Units (LIU) demolishes their shacks again. This bold threat came with a physical warning, early on Friday, when about two hundred people allegedly from the newly built eKanini Informal settlement marched through Blinkbonnie, Buckingham and Carnforth Roads rolling and carrying tyres which they set alight at various intersections. Several homes were also stoned and damaged along Carlow Road. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
