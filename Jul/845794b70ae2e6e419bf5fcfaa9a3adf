Colin Pillay, a tow truck driver, faces three counts of murder for the death of Jane, 45, a receptionist, and her daughters Denisha, 22, and Nikita, 16, a Grade 11 pupil. In an earlier interview with POST Govindsamy said that he had lost everything and even though he did not have the will to go on living, he somehow found the strength. According to indictments Pillay claimed he was involved in an extra marital affair with Jane and found out that she was seeing another person, which is when he decided to kill her. Govindsamy added that even if his wife had been having an affair, she did not deserve to die that way. “No one has the right to take another person’s life, especially if you claim to love them.” The trial has been set down until August 8. The State is expected to call 38 witnesses. POST
