Durban - Loga Pillay, the husband of slain KZN former principal has arrived at the Durban High Court with a photograph of his wife in his hand. Gona Pillay was brutally murdered in their Silverglen home in September 2018. The couple came under attack during a viewing of their home which had been for sale. Loga survived being stabbed 17 times and said that while it won't bring his wife back, he is glad that the month-long trial is coming to an end. Intern estate agent Lungani Basil Underhill, 26, his cousin Braveman Underhill, 25, and Fredboy Msomi, 30, have pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, attempted murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances.  Earlier in the trial during his evidence-in-chief, Pillay told the Durban High Court how he watched helplessly as the attackers strangled his wife to death. "She was a gemÂ and extraordinary women," said Pillay clutching on to her photograph. He is being supported by members of his family. POST
