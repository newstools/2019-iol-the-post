Durban - A 32-year-old woman accused of dumping her baby in a drain in February, has been given permission to see her daughter. The woman, who cannot be named as she has two other children, had requested that her bail conditions be relaxed so that she would be able to spend time with the now five-month-old baby girl. Her attorney, Jacques Botha, said the court granted her permission. The baby, who was named Sibani-Sethu Gabrielle (which means ‘Our Light’) was retrieved from the drain in Barracuda Road, Newlands East, during a three-hour-long rescue in February. Sibani-Sethu Gabrielle’s cries were heard by a resident who was walking along the road. Iyron Lovedale lifted the lid of a drain on the road and spotted the crying baby. He rushed to get help and within minutes, emergency services arrived at the scene. Once rescued from the drain, the baby was airlifted to the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital for a check up. The woman was arrested a week later and charged with attempted murder. The Mercury
