Durban - Thursday will mark five weeks since Westville businesswoman Sandra Moonsamy has been missing; but her family remain hopeful she will return home. Moonsamy, 45, the financial director of Crossmoor Transport Plant, was snatched by unknown assailants in Stapleton Road, Pinetown, on May 30. Her brother Inderan Naicker said they remained optimistic that she will be "returned to us safely." "We are working closely with authorities to follow up on any new leads and seek out new details, which could assist us in locating her." Naicker said that it is crucial to the investigation that South African citizens and the media refrain from sharing or publishing any information that is not verified, as this could hamper the on-going investigations, essentially putting Sandra's well-being at further risk. "We continue to marvel at the kindness and support we have received from all over the country and want to sincerely thank all those supporting us for their generosity during this difficult time," said Naicker. He added that the family requests that any information pertinent to the investigation be directed immediately to the Hawks Reaction Unit on 086 123 4333. A spokesperson for the Hawks Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo could not be reached for comment. POST
