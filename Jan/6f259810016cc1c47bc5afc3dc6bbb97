Durban - IN a bid to clamp down on illegal trade and unfair competition within the business sector, KZN MEC for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs, Sihle Zikalala will officially launch the province-wide campaign directed at effective implementation of business regulations. The launch will take place at the Durban City Hall on Tuesday at 9 am. The proliferation of illegal business enterprises which has caused severe anger among KwaZulu-Natal residents sparked the provincial government’s intervention through their business regulation programme. “We decided to develop a programme aimed at curbing illegal trade after we received numerous complaints about the rise of businesses which operate without permits in all parts of the province. “ We want to thank our communities for having worked with us as we developed this programme,” said Zikalala. Local government leaders, including mayors, speakers and municipality managers as well as representatives of small scale businesses and corporate sector will be in attendance at the launch. POST
