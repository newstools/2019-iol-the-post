Members from the private security company KZN VIP, who were at a training exercise, took photographs and posted them on Facebook. Director Glen Naidoo said they had come across a stream that bordered the park and found severed heads of chickens, goats and sheep and what looked like the intestines of a large animal. “It looked like some sort of sacrificial offering had taken place,” said Naidoo, who added the stench was unbearable. He said while it was respected that people performed rituals and prayers, the rotting animal remains were a health hazard and could lead to airborne diseases. Naidoo said they were unable to remove the carcasses but had notified the eThekwini Municipality’s parks and recreation department. MF Phoenix councillor Jonathan Annipen said: “People who practise the slaughtering of animals for whatever reason, should dispose of the waste in a way that does not cause harm to others.” POST Annipen added that regular inspections on vacant spots and secluded spaces should be conducted to prevent such incidents.
