A relative, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the minor child, said the little girl was accompanied by her father and other family members. She was eager to meet her teacher and make new friends. “She hugged and kissed us and hurried into her classroom. We were all so emotional, but she was our brave princess. "She then waved goodbye to us as she was anxious to start school.” The relative said that as the new school year neared, the child looked forward to shopping for a new school uniform and shoes and repeatedly asked how many more sleeps until the academic year started. “She even helped with covering her books.” The relative said the private education was funded by their family, and the funds in the attorney’s trust account were being used for her psychologist visits which would be long-term. The consultations are aimed at helping her cope with the trauma she had experienced. “We are so proud of her and the strides she has made. She spent an entire month in hospital nursing her injuries and at one point we never thought we would get this far. But she is our little fighter and we know she will do well in school.” The video went viral on social media in March and showed a woman stomping on and kicking the girl because she had urinated on the floor. The child’s hands, legs and parts of her body were severely swollen. The woman, 25, and her boyfriend, 20, were arrested and charged with attempted murder. They are currently out on bail. POST Their trial is expected to start in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court next month.
