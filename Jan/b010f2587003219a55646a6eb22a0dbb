Durban - A Taxify driver was severely assaulted and thrown out of his vehicle during a hijacking in Newlands West on Wednesday evening. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said it is alleged that at 4 pm, the victim, 28, who is a Taxify driver, picked up three male passengers from the Durban CBD to transport them to Hillgrove in Newlands West. "They were seated in his silver-grey VW Polo and as they drove into Hillgrove the passengers pointed a firearm at him demanding his vehicle." Zwane said the driver was assaulted and thrown out of the vehicle. "The suspects drove off in the vehicle. A case of carjacking is being investigated by Newlands East SAPS."
