Durban - IN honour of the build-up to the ANC’s manifesto tomorrow, members of the National Executive Committee embarked on a meet and greet campaign in Phoenix on Friday morning. Former State Security and Energy minister David Mahlobo, together with former COSATU boss Sdumo Dlamini made their way to the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital where they greeted patients, discussed some of the issues plaguing the hospital and also solutions. While it seems long queues are one of the biggest issues plaguing the state hospital, the members believe a newly built hospital - built in Bridge City - will lessen the load of the hospital. “The hospital should be ready and open for patients soon. We believe it will help take a load of this hospital because we understand at the moment people from surrounding areas are coming here for treatment and so the wait for medical attention takes longer,” said Mahlobo. After their visit to the hospital, the minister and his entourage made their way to Greenbury Secondary School in Phoenix where they met with matriculants and encouraged them to give it their all this year.
