Durban - POLICE are set to intensify patrols following a spate of robberies at doctors surgeries in Phoenix and more recently in Effingham Heights. They have warned other medical practitioners to be extra careful of copy cat criminals using a similar modus operandi. In two weeks three doctors surgeries in Phoenix came under attack with the most recent being at Effingham Heights. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said police have taken note of robberies at doctorâ€™s consulting rooms. "The police officers will intensify their patrols in those areas. We are also appealing to those responsible for the security of those premises to take extra precautions." Mbele said they need to increase their security and not keep large amounts of cash on the premises. "They must immediately contact police if they witness any suspicious behaviour in and around their premises." Mbele said as with all other crimes, as these incidents are receiving heightened coverage, one can expect more copycat criminals to follow suit and therefore we are calling on people to be extra vigilant.
