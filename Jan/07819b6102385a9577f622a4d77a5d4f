Neighbours were alerted and he was seen trying to gain entry into a home in Eastbury. Glen Naidoo, of a private security company KZN VIP Security Unit, said one of the residents activated the panic alarm. "The burglar fled and within minutes was apprehended by members of KZN VIP. He was found in possession of multiple dangerous weapons. He revealed to us that he had been involved in stealing copper from homes in Phoenix. He also pointed out several houses that he stole from," Naidoo said. When reaction officers emptied out his pockets they found the blades of knives in various shapes, knives in different shapes and sizes, a nail clipper, spanners, several pairs of scissors, pliers, screwdrivers, various other objects and surprisingly a calculator. When the picture was posted on the Phoenix Crime Watch Facebook page people ridiculed the burglar and pondered what he could be using the calculator for.
