Durban - The National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) has announced dates for public hearings on Eskom's application to increase electricity tariffs annually from 2019 to 2021/2022 by 15%. The application was made to recover revenue totaling R762 billion over the next three financial years from electricity users through increased tariffs. According to Nersa, Eskom’s Third Multi-Year Price Determination (MYPD3) Regulatory Clearing Account totals R219bn, R252bn and R291bn for 2019/20, 2020/21 and 2021/22 financial years respectively. The 15%  annual tariff increase is said to be over and above the 4% Nersa had already granted Eskom for 2019 for earlier expenses. Nersa will start public hearings around the country on January 14. It will commence in Cape Town and end in Johannesburg on February 4. The Durban hearings will take place on January 17 at the ICC from 9am to 5pm. "Members of the public and stakeholders wishing to make their presentations and attend the hearings must submit their requests by 3.30pm on Friday, January 4, 2019," read the statement. Nersa also made it clear that should they not receive any requests to present at the advertised public hearings by the closing date they will retain the right not to hold the scheduled hearings.
