Durban - The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police are calling on matriculants interested in law enforcement to apply at their nearest police station, before Friday, January 18. Chairperson Francois Beukman said matriculants who wish to contribute to society and serve to achieve a safer South Africa are encouraged to apply to become trainees within SAPS. “Young people between the ages of 18 and 30 who are in possession of a Grade 12 certificate and have the necessary fitness levels should make use of Saps’ first 2019 recruitment opportunity.” "We need dedicated, motivated and energetic young people, who want to make a difference to the crime situation in the country, and who will lead by example," Beukman said. Beukman added that the committee fully supports the strict vetting criteria and psychometric testing used by SAPS to establish if applicants are suitable for the job. “Aspiring police members must have no links to criminality and fit the profile of a career law-enforcement officer."
