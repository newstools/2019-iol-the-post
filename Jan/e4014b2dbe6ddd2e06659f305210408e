Durban - The Verulam man accused of raping his 10-year-old stepdaughter more than 900 times over a five year period appeared briefly in the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Friday morning. The case was postponed to February 22 for the Director of Public Prosecutions to make a decision on whether the case will be heard in the High Court. The man was arrested in June and faces charges of sexual grooming, exposure of a child to pornography, sexual assault, and child neglect. He was denied bail in July on the basis that the accused was found to be a threat to society and to the child. However, the man's legal aid attorney argued that the matter is going on for too long. Prosecutor San Bhartu said the 10-year-old girl claimed in an interview she had been raped every second day between 2013 and 2018. The court ordered that the child be re-interviewed during the school holidays for the second time. Daily News
