Durban - The search for a missing KwaZulu-Natal girl continues despite claims that she was found. SiphesihleÂ Zamangwane Dlamini went missing during a church service on the South Coast on December 31, 2017. Since then, an extensive search has been launched for her and a reward of R40 000 offered for her safe return. A Facebook page has also been created called, Help Find Missing Siphesihle, that continues to keep the community updated on the progress of the search. Last week, claims surfaced on social media that she was found. It was further claimed that DNA tests were outstanding. However, according to those working on the case, Siphesihle has not been found as yet. "Despite the recent report made, Siphesihle's case is still open and we are continuing to actively search. We will keep you informed of any developments," a post on the Help Find Missing Siphesihle page read. It is alleged that the young girl found has already been claimed by her family. In the meantime, anyone with information about Siphesihle's whereabouts is urged to contact Brad Nathanson on 083 250 2007 or the nearest police station. Daily News
