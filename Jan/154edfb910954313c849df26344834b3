Durban -  A Springfield family watched helplessly as balaclava-clad hijackers pulled them out of their vehicle and took their relative on a terror ride to Umlazi. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the complainant alleged that on Wednesday around 7.50pm he was coming home from the shop with his family and as they were jumping off their car,  a white Golf TSI, he noticed a vehicle had parked next to him. "Four suspects jumped off the vehicle, pulled down balaclavas to cover their faces and dragged his family out the vehicle. They pushed him back into his vehicle, drove off and dropped him off at Philani Mall in Umlazi area." Head of National Assistance South Africa (NASA) Nandhan Arran said the victim was not harmed during the ordeal but robbed of his wallet containing his bank card. "When he was dropped off by suspects he went to residents for help and contacted his family." Mbele added that a case of carjacking was opened at Sydenham police station for investigation. POST
