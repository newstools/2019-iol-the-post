They had a cycle and we did not have to call them out to our homes. They had a tractor and a team of grass cutters, and the open spaces, play-lots and the road verges were cut. Now we have contractors and they don't even have a tractor. I saw only two men cutting the grass and that's why they don't cut all the grass. I told the ward councillor and the Phoenix parks and garden department to cut the small open space, between Newton Park and Central Park Drive, on which the storm water drain is situated. They cut a small patch and left. The municipality said they would inform them, but two months have passed and nothing has happened. Snakes and rats enter our properties. The parks department said the open spaces were not their land, but they are getting paid by ratepayers and are part and parcel of the municipality. I am going to send an email to the president if they do not cut the grass soon. POST
