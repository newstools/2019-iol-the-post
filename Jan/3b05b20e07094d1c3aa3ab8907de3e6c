Durban - The community of Chatsworth are calling for new measures to be implemented to curb the spate of substance abuse in the area. These concerns were raised at a community dialogue hosted by the Anti-Drug Forum in Chatsworth. The meeting was held at the forum's headquarters in Arena Park. John Jeffery The Deputy Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development was in attendance. Dr Anand Chetty, chairman of the forum said the government needs to look at re-introducing guidance counsellors at schools who will help steer pupils away from drugs and down a more positive path. “I am a product of positive influence from a guidance counsellor and I believe it will help transform our schools.” Another member of the community said the justice department needs to look at implementing programmes to upskill offenders. “Most of these offenders have nothing to look forward to when they are freed and normally work with drug cartels to push out more drugs.” Jeffrey said he intended returning to Chatsworth in a month or two to report back to the community on some of the issues raised. “Once I speak to key stakeholders involved I would like to come back and provide feedback on solid solutions.” POST
