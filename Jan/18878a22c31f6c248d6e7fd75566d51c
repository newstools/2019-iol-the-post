Pregasen Clive Rampertab, 32, of Jhelum Road, went missing in March. He was last seen at a known drug dealer’s home. Twelve days later, friends and family members found a decomposed body behind Ganges Secondary School, near the overhead bridge on Himalaya Drive. Even after identifying a tattoo on the corpse’s foot and a red T-shirt that clung to the remains, authorities have not yet returned the body to the family - in spite of their conviction that it is their loved one. Rampertab’s wife, Keshnie, said: “I made inquiries again in December, but was yet again told the DNA testing was incomplete and that I should be patient. I cannot understand this. “People dig up graves 30 years later, but my husband’s body was found 12 days later and still nothing. I find our case to be weird.” She said that last August, she was told the man would be given a pauper’s burial and three months later, the DNA testing was seemingly continuing. Keshnie said her father-in-law, who had inked her husband’s tattoo, saw it on the man’s body, and the red T-shirt she had bought for him in 2010. Rampertab worked at a tent company, and Keshnie had the words “Your tent or mine?” with a picture of a tent printed on the garment. His mother, Daisy, said despite knowing the body was that of her son, she nevertheless continued to search for him. “We went into the most dangerous places, and even to known drug dealers’ homes, looking for him but no one has seen him since the body was found.” The family had kept a fast for 65 days and conducted rituals in the hope that Rampertab’s spirit was at peace. The police had not commented by deadline. POST
