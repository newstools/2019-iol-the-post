Durban - A school-going teenage mother has urged her peers across the province to be mindful of the dangers and consequences of unprotected sex. The 17-year-old pupil from the Amajuba district fell pregnant at the age of 16, and was forced to temporarily put her studies on hold. The youngster who was speaking at the start of a three-day school functionality inspection visit led by Amajuba District political champion,  KZN Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo and Deputy Chief Whip, MPL Super Zuma, advised her peers to “behave”. “As a girl, you have to behave yourself. If I had not fallen pregnant, I would have finished school last year and gone to varsity. “It’s important for my peers who are planning to get sexually active to go to the clinic to get advice on family planning. Falling pregnant when you are still young is not okay,” she said. MEC Dhlomo urged all young people to abstain from sex, or approach their local clinic to seek contraceptives or any other sexual reproductive health services, which are available free of charge. He added that the health department has trained hundreds of nurses at various clinics in Adolescent and Youth User Friendly Services. “This training equips healthcare professionals with the skills to make young people feel welcome to seek services without fear of being judged or ostracized,” he said.
