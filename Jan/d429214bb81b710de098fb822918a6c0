Durban - THE four men accused of shooting and killing a well-known Clairwood businessman and bodybuilder will have to wait till next month to apply for bail. Brandon Arumugan, 28, Alister Govender, 34, Bilal Shaik, 41 and Leon Veerasamy appeared briefly in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Thursday. The men were arrested and charges for the murder of Sanjay Juggernath,34, who was shot on the corner of Flower and Ganesh Road in Clairwood, on December 22. The gym and nightclub owner was returning to his home when he came under attack. He sustained 17 gunshot wounds his face, back and legs and died at the scene. The accused who were arrested hours later, were also injured during what is believed to have been a “gunfire showdown”. They were hospitalised shortly after their arrest and kept under police guard. On Tuesday, all four accused were expected to appear in court for a bail consideration, but only three arrived. On Thursday, Juggernath’s sister-in-law Nirvana told POST that the family was “relieved” that the bail application was a month away. POST “All we want now is that justice is served, and for those that have committed such a heinous crime to our loved one, to be punished.”
