Durban - The daughter of the elderly man who had become unwell at the country-style eatery, Piggly Wiggly, has accepted the owners' apology. Loshini Lawrence said they met with the owners, Rudi and Cindy Kassier, on Sunday and encouraged the couple to address the online concerns of the public, who have been vocal about their own alleged bad experiences, including racism. "We urged them to take serious steps to address the public's concern regarding racism at their business . . . " She said they had also spoken to the couple about the false comment Rudi Kassier had made to the press about her dad, Jerry Naicker, 82, having had a heart attack a week prior to the incident that went viral on social media. On Tuesday, the owners posted their apology on their Facebook page. On December 23, Naicker's family shared a photograph of Naicker being treated at the back of the establishment, near the toilets and on a pile of wood, by paramedics. A video that also accompanied the photo showed Cindy addressing concerned family. She allegedly also screamed at an ambulance service to move off the grass when they arrived to attend to Naicker, who had fallen ill. The post sparked outrage with hundreds of people vowing not to go, or return, to the establishment. POST
