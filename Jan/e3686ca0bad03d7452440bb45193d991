Durban - Former top cop Vincent Mdunge who was convicted to five years for presenting a fake matric certificate appeared in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Thursday. Mdunge who was the police spokesperson has applied for his prison sentence to be converted to correctional supervision. Even though Mdunge is currently a prisoner at Westville Prison he came to court dressed in a suit. He is representing himself and his application is being supported by the parole board. Mdunge was convicted on fraud and forgery in 2014 and was convicted to five years in jail in 2015. However, Mdunge remained on bail until he appealed his sentence and only began actively serving his sentence in August 2017 when the Supreme Court of Appeal upheld his sentence. The Daily News reported that Magistrate Thandeka Fikeni found Mdunge had presented a fake matric certificate that secured him a promotion, advanced his career in the police service and gained him entry to the University of South Africa (Unisa) to continue his studies. He was convicted on one charge of fraud for receiving a salary to which he was not entitled, and another for the forged matric certificate. The matter was adjourned to January 31 for the complete charge sheet to be presented to the court. Daily News
