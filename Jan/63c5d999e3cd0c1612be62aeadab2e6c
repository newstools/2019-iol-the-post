Imam Abdul Moutie Saban, religious leader at the Bo-Kaap’s Jameah Masjid in Lower Chiappini Street for the past 40 years, has photographs showing the minstrels urinating on the walls. Saban had warned about the potential for this behaviour before the parade and organisers said they made efforts to provide public toilets. “The organisers should take responsibility for this. We cannot allow this behaviour. This is a sacred place. People who saw this said the minstrels didn’t even take any notice of them when they tried to stop them.” Saban had also said that in a December 16 minstrel event, “half-naked girls” entered local mosques to use toilets. “About 15 buses came into the area A group of young girls and some adults just walked into the masjid half-naked and they wanted to use the toilets. Confrontations ensued because the worshippers are not used to this. When they were told the mosque did not have a public toilet, they became abusive.” Muneeb Gambeno, director of the Kaapse Klopse Karnival Association, which organised the parade, said they “don’t condone this type of anti-social behaviour”. “We apologise on behalf of all of the fraternity. We cautioned the troupe leaders. “We posted notices and requests via our Facebook page,” said Gambeno. “We supplied sufficient toilets.” POST
