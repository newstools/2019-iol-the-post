Durban - The community of Chatsworth is pleased that the decision to implement permits at the Chatsworth Stadium has temporarily been put on hold. Eight people from the Chatsworth community met with City Mayor  Zandile Gumede on Wednesday to discuss the way forward. At the beginning of January, a notice was placed at the Chatsworth Stadium urging residents to purchase their permits to continue making use of the stadium. However, this was widely rejected as many residents claimed they had not been paying this fee for almost 20 years. Soon after the meeting, the mayor's office released a statement that the payment of the permit at the stadium had been temporarily “put on hold”. It read: “The decision was taken after representatives of the Chatsworth Community met with eThekwini Municipality, Cllr Zandile Gumede, to hear their concerns regarding the requirement to pay for the permits. “Mayor Gumede indicated that she will gather all facts from the relevant officials and engage the Municipality’s Executive Council before a decision is made on whether or not the permits should be paid for by the athletes using the stadium for training purposes.” Chatsworth community activist, Devan Naicker described the meeting as positive. "I am happy that the meeting with the Mayor turned out to be a victory for the community of Chatsworth, ( although a temporary one), this shows what power and influence we can have as a community when we stand together, united, fighting a common cause with a steadfast resolve to stand up for what is right.” He added Gumede had been reasonable with the request of the delegation. “The Mayor has been reasonable with our delegation's requests. She has not been condescending towards us. We are grateful for that.” POST
