Durban -  The Department of Home Affairs has extended its working hours ahead of the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) final voter registration drive this weekend. The spokesperson for the department Siya Qoza said branches across the country will be extending their working hours to ensure that South Africans get the documents they need to register for the upcoming general elections. "All offices will be open from 8 am until 5 pm on Saturday and Sunday. The aim is to ensure citizens have an opportunity to collect and apply for their identity documents." Oaza said those wanting to apply for passports or other documentation will not be turned away but the priority was to ensure the backlog of identity documents were collected. The Chairperson of Portfolio Committee on the department Hlomani Chauke urged all South Africans to take advantage of the last registration weekend. “The right to vote is enshrined in the Constitution and many people have fought, even died, to ensure that all South Africans participate in the democratic project of the country. This reason alone should be encouragement enough for people to vote,” he said. POST
