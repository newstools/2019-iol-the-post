Durban - Security officers arrested a suspected business robber after a high-speed chase through Newlands early on Friday morning. Marshall Security spokesman Kyle van Reenen said that at 5.30am, security officers intercepted suspects wanted for multiple business robberies as well as the attempted murder of a private security officer. "Special Operations Team members spotted two vehicles travelling at high speed on Inanda Road and began following them towards Newlands. A high-speed chase ensued with the suspects opening fire on our officers who returned fire," said van Reenen. "The driver of one of the vehicle lost control, colliding with a boundary wall in Bodley Grove, Newlands West. Five suspects alighted from the vehicle and fled on foot into nearby bushes. One man was caught by members of Marshall Security and the South African Police Services Provincial Trio Crimes Task Team," he said. Van Reenen said the vehicle contained several computers confirmed to have been taken in a robbery at a business premises in the Durban CBD earlier on Friday morning. "A firearm containing live ammunition and several housebreaking implements were recovered. The suspect vehicle was fitted with false registration plates," he said. He said the suspects have been linked to several cases of business robbery in the greater Durban area as well as a shooting and attempted murder of a private security officer in the Morningside area last week. The scene was secured and handed over to the South African Police Services.
