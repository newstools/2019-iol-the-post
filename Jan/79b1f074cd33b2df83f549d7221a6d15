Durban - The Department of Labour has issued a reminder to all national employers to submit their employment equity (EE) online reports in line with legislation. The closing date for mandatory online reports is one day away (January 15, 2019) while manual submissions have already closed. The 2018 EE Online and Manual reporting season opened in September 2018. The report is to verify compliance with the EE Act and looks at demographic profiles, gender representation and EE plans on how to address discrimination and inequity in the workplace. "The purpose of the EE Act is to achieve equity in the workplace by promoting equity opportunity and fair treatment in employment and implementing affirmative action measures to redress the disadvantages in employment experienced by designated groups, in order to ensure equitable representation in all occupational categories and levels in the workplace," said Lucia Rayner, Department of Labour's deputy director of EE. Once all reports are issued, the Commission for Employment Equity (CEE) will be required to submit an annual report to the Labour Minister on the state of equity in South Africa. The CEE advises the Labour Minister on matters relating to employment equity in the workplace. POST
