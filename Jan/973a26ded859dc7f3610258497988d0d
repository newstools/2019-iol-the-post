Speaking to The Daily News this week, Jaci said that her daughter has made great progress. "She fed herself on Friday morning and was even able to walk around the ward. She said while her speech was not back hundred percent she was able to read her name on the patient hospital board and could recall events leading up the accident on Christmas Eve. Jaci said she was grateful to the public for their prayers and support and said she was hoping her daughter makes a full recovery. She said both she and her husband have prayed with the person driving the motorbike. "We hope he makes a full recovery. His concern is finding work again." Daily News
