Durban - Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Dr Zweli Mkhize, came under fire after he shared photographs of himself exiting a hut during a visit to Ward 5 in Georgedale near Hammarsdale earlier today. Mkhize's visit to the area formed part of ongoing celebrations marking the African National Congress's 107th anniversary. Mkhize shared the photographs on his Twitter shortly after, adding that the elderly woman lived alone in the house.
