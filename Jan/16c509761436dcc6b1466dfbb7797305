Durban - A motorist was wounded during a shooting outside a Glenwood business premises on Thursday morning. The man was able to drive himself to a nearby petrol station for assistance. Blue Security's Andreas Mathios said the man was seated in his car at the time. "Five suspects forced their way into the business premises in Helen Joseph (Davenport) Road at around 5.20am. The suspects forced open a security gate to enter the business premises and fled with televisions. The suspects spotted a motorist who happened to be sitting in his vehicle which was parked nearby and opened fire on him. It is unclear how many shots were fired but at least one shot hit the motorist who managed to drive his car to a nearby petrol station to get help,” Mathios said. He said paramedics also responded to the scene. “ER24 paramedics stabilised the victim before transporting him to hospital,” Mathios said. He said Umbilo SAPS will be investigating further. Meanwhile, in a separate incident, three armed men hijacked a man outside a home in Glenmore. “The motorist left the key in the ignition and got out of his vehicle to open the driveway gates but as he was in the process of opening the gate three armed suspects arrived in a Khaki Toyota Yaris. They held him up at gunpoint and robbed him of his wallet before fleeing in his vehicle. No injuries were reported,” Mathios said. Umbilo SAPS attended the scene of the crime. Mathios advised residents to be vigilant when leaving their properties and arriving home. “Residential driveways are a prime hotspot for hijackings so it is important to always be alert when pulling up outside your property. Always stop parallel to the verge so that you can make a quick getaway if any suspicious vehicles approach you. If you notice any suspicious individuals loitering near your property rather take a drive around the block and contact your security company and the police for assistance if the suspects do not move on,” Mathios said.
