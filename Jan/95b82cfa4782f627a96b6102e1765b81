Durban - AM Moolla Spes Nova pupil Nomfundo Nqobile Khuzwayo did not let her illness stand in the way of achieving her dreams. The 20 year old pupil who suffered a hypoxic brain injury after going into cardiac arrest in 2011, and is wheelchair bound beat the odds and passed matric with flying colours. School principal Anandh Appanna shared her story at the  Mafukuzela Gandhi Circuit Management Centre awards ceremony held this week. Appanna said that due to her illness Nqobile could not use her hands during the exams and used a laptop as an assisted device to write her exams. "We are very proud of her." Nomfundo has been accepted to study towards a degree in social science at UKZN. Two other schools in the Phoenix district also received top honours. They were Earlington Secondary who achieved a 98,8% pass rate and Lenarea Secondary with 94% percent pass rate. Earlington Secondary school principal Dean Achary said: "We attained a 100% pass rate in several subjects, including English, physics, Accounting and Drama. The pupils have done the school and community proud." The school's top pupil Neloufur Hamid, attained six distinctions, which had surpassed all her expectations. She aims to pursue studies in either the science or accounting fields. "I have been provisionally accepted at Wits and am more likely to be looking towards a BCom accounting degree. I've always wanted to open up my own firm one day." Her advice to the class of 2019: "Your parents are there to help you. Go to them if you are struggling to focus. They are the best support structure you can find." Evashen Morgan Pillay of Lenarea Secondary, who attained 7 distinctions and an overall aggregate of 94.5%, placed first in the district and 8th in KZN. He also bagged 99% for physical science and received an award. He said he sacrificed going out with friends to focus on his studies, and stressed the importance of working consistently throughout the year. Evashen hopes to study medicine at UKZN. Daily News
