Durban - The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) is expected to conduct voter registration at prisons across the country for the upcoming general elections The registrations will be held next Tuesday and Wednesday. And inlight of this the IEC’s Chief Electoral Officer Sy Mamabolo has appealed to family members of inmates to take their identity documents to their respective Correctional Centres by Monday. “Most offenders do not keep their ID documents with them and they are often kept at home by family members,” explained Chief Electoral Officer Sy Mamabolo. “In the past, this has inhibited voter registration among inmates.” He said these documents can be the form of either a smart card ID, a barcoded ID book or a temporary ID certificate. The National Commissioner of Correctional Services, Arthur Fraser, said facilities would be made available to keep the ID documents safe for voter registration and then return these to family members during their next visit. There are on average approximately 160 000 offenders including remand detainees in South Africa’s 240 prisons. Daily News
