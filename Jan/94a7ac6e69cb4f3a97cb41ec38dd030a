Durban - WHEN a Chatsworth paramedic saw a post circulating on social media about a missing elderly man he recognised his face immediately and made inroads to help the family get closure. Robin Singh, 63, had been missing since Monday afternoon. Siven Subramoney, owner of Amawele Emergency Services said when he saw the picture he instantly recognised the face. “On Monday I was called out to an accident where a pedestrian had been hit. "When my team and I got to the scene we started treating the patient. I noticed his grey hair and when I saw the missing person post I knew it was the same man.” Subramoney said he immediately contacted the man's family - who lived not far from the accident scene. “I asked for a description of the male and another photo and I was asked by the family to go over to their home. "After meeting them last night I was sure it was the same person I treated on Monday night and the family have positively identified the body.” Singh's brother, David said they had been searching for him frantically since Monday. “When we got the call from paramedics Siven and Lukcandis we had some sort of relief, but its sad that he passed on. We are all holding on and trying to be strong,” he said. David, who identified his brother's body, said they are busy with funeral arrangements. KZN police did not respond by the time of publication.
