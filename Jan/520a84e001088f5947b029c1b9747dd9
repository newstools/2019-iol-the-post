Durban - Two men accused of fatally shooting a Chatsworth teenager during an alleged family dispute on Sunday evening have been remanded in police custody. Huzair Bux, 32, and Dilen Pillay, 25, appeared in the Chatsworth Magistrate's Court on Tuesday after they handed themselves over to police. They have been remanded in police custody until Friday for further investigations. The men have been charged with murder following the death of Dilano Govender, 19, from Bayview. He  died en-route to RK Khan Hospital after being shot in the neck and leg. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the shooting was a result of a family dispute. "The accused handed themselves over to police on Monday. A licensed firearm was also handed to police. It will be taken for ballistic testing." The accused will appear in court again later this week. In an earlier interview, the victim's aunt, Devarani Govender, said his parents, Cheryl and Eugene, and younger brother, Donnel, were unable to accept his death. "We cannot believe he was taken from us in such a cruel manner. We are justice and those responsible to be brought to book." POST
