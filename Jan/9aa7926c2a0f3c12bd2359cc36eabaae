Well, that is exactly what happened to Jonathan Jacobs a Sydenham youngster who dances for local dance crew, Show Dem Entertainment. A video of him dancing with his friends at his high school last year, has been viewed over two millions times on Instagram after it was posted by American artists; Chris Brown and Jermaine Dupri.
