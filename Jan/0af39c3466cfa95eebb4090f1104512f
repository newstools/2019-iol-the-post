Durban - AN AVOCA family are trying to rebuild their lives after their rented home was gutted in a fire, a day after they celebrated Christmas. Ravi Pillay, 51, his wife Monica, 48, their children Keegan, 17, and Esther, 7, lost all their belongs when a car battery allegedly exploded in the one bedroom home. Their oldest daughter, Karmini Pillay said their lives have been thrown into turmoil. "This is a double blow for our family. A week before the fire my mother suffered a heart attack and was admitted to Addington Hospital. On December 21 she was discharged and with my father and siblings began living with me in Hillary while she recovered." Pillay said on December 26 they were informed by a relative that their home was on fire. "They called the fire department for help but the flames were too strong and high. It destroyed everything. Firefighters on the scene told our relatives they suspected the fire was caused by the car battery." Pillay said her family is now in need of a place to stay. "My siblings are going back to school on Wednesday and for them to travel from Hillary to Avoca is a distance. They also need clothing because everything has been destroyed." The incident is being investigated by the Greenwood Park Police Station. POST
