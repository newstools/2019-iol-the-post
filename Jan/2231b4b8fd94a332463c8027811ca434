Durban - A Verulam mother who allegedly gave birth and thereafter dumped her newborn boy baby in a plastic packet meters from her home has made her first appearance at the Verulam Magistrate's Court. Jeneve Venkatido, 31, made a brief appearance at the court earlier on Wednesday. She was granted bail of R1 000. She is expected back in court at the end of the month. On Monday the mother of two was arrested after the discovery of the abandoned infant on Olivine Road. Reaction Unit South Africa director Prem Balram said when they arrived on scene, they found the baby wrapped in a denim garment. He said if they had they arrived at the scene any later, the baby would have been crushed by a bin truck that had entered the road to collect the refuse. The 2.3kg newborn was treated on scene and taken to a hospital, where he is doing well. After receiving information, officers then proceeded to a nearby home where they arrested Venkatido. POST
