Durban - The KZN MEC for Education Mthandeni Dlungwane visited Mvuzo High School in Pietermaritzburg that was set alight over the weekend. According to the Department of Education, the administration block of the school had been burnt two days before the 2019 school year. Dlungwane said they had decided to have an emergency visit to engage all relevant stakeholders to ensure that teaching and learning begins at the school. "As you know the school was set alight on Sunday, and we were really disappointed that such expensive infrastructure was destroyed and our community failed to protect. "But luckily textbooks and all other stationery were saved because it was kept at a safe room. Experts are still calculating the costs for damages," said Dlungwane. He said the school was illegally closed on the first day and that it was not a decision taken by the Department. "That's why when we heard that teaching and learning were not taking place, we then rushed here. I came here to ensure challenges and problems are resolved.  We will make sure the time for studying that pupils have missed out on today will be recovered. I always emphasize first day, first hour, first minute of school opening must be used to teach and study. There's no time to rest." KZN police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of arson had been opened at Alexandra Road SAPS. "The complainant alleged that on January 6 at 02:15aam he received information that the school was on fire. Upon arrival he noticed that the roof and stationery were damaged by unknown people, " said Captain Nqobile Gwala. Gwala said no arrests had been made. Daily News
