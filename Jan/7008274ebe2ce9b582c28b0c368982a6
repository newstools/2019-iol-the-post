Durban - TWO men accused of the alleged murder of Umbilo businessman, Kidesh Ramjettan, are expected to appear in the Durban Magistrate's Court. Menziwa Mdaka and Â Zakhele Dubazane are expected to apply for bail. Ramjettan, 37, a father of one, was shot at his petrol station in Rossburgh in August while he was standing outside talking a customer. The shooting was captured on CCTV and widely circulated on social media. Mdaka and Dubazane were arrested two months later with their co-accused and trigger man Ayanda Shezi. Shezi, 34, pleaded guilty days after his arrest and told the court he had been hired by Mdaka to carry out the shooting and being a taxi driver, money was tight so he accepted the job. He was jailed for life. He also claimed the reason they were hired to kill Ramjettan was that Ramjettan had been involved in "wrong" or "illegal" business. The State is opposing bail. POST
