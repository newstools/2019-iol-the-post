Durban - CHATSWORTH residents are being urged to sign a petition against a jogging permit at the Chatsworth Stadium. Since Monday, Desmond Kylas, an exco member of the Active Citizens Movement and Chatsworth resident has been sitting outside the stadium for two hours collecting signatures. This comes after a notice was placed at the stadium on Thursday urging joggers to obtain their permit for access to the stadium. For years residents had been using the stadium without paying for a permit however an urgent meeting held on Friday revealed a policy for a permit has always been in place however was not implemented at the stadium. Since the start of this week, Kylas said he has received over 400 signatures. He added that he is expecting to see more people sign the petition which will be handed over to the mayor's office. Kylas, who is an active jogger and visits the stadium twice a week with his family, said the stadium has been home to hundreds of residents since its inception. “For years people come out with their families to bond and keep fit. It is a safe haven for people as the streets are not safe.” Kylas will be at the stadium collecting signatures between 4pm and 6pm until Friday. POST
