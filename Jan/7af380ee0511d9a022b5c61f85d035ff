Durban - Imagine playing the guitar while a doctor is operating on your brain? Well, that is the story of popular jazz musician and UKZN music lecturer Musa Manzini who recently underwent Awake Craniotomy surgery at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital in Durban. The operation was done by the head of neurology Dr Basil Enicker and his team.   Enicker, 41, said what was unique and exciting about the procedure itself, is that it was the first time it was performed on a musician. Enicker said during the procedure Manzini was asked to play the guitar. "The reason for this was the need to maintain and improve the use of fine motor skills of the left hand, including the ability to continue making music. "The brain tumour was located in the right frontal lobe (in the primary motor cortex) which is an area of the brain responsible for planning, control and execution of voluntary movements. The procedure was a huge success." Since news of the success of this operation Enicker has been inundated with interview requests from various media houses including BBC. KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC  Sibongiseni Dhlomo has lauded Enicker as a great example of what can be achieved through hard work and tenacity. “His is a very encouraging story. We need to put in place systems that will ensure that more Black Africans are afforded the space and support to realise their potential like Dr Enicker. We are extremely proud of him, and what he’s achieved,” said the MEC. Umlazi born Enicker who was inspired by his grandmother, a nurse, to pursue a career in medicine graduated as a specialist Neurosurgeon in 2010 from UKZN. He is married with two children and his long-term goal in his profession is to train as many neurosurgeons as possible and groom the next generation of leaders in Neurosurgery. Daily News
