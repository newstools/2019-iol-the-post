Durban - Asibonge Mdlalose, who was arrested following a brazen hijacking and abduction in Durban last year, has been denied bail. Mdlalose appeared in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Thursday where he made his formal application for bail. He was charged with robbery with aggravating circumstances and kidnapping. In December last year, Mdlalose and his accomplices allegedly hijacked Marta Rubilar just minutes after she parked her vehicle outside her place of work. The men were seen on CCTV footage, shoving Rubilar back into her vehicle, while another man grabbed her handbag. Two men then got into another car and drove off while one of the men with Rubilar sped off in her car. A search was then initiated for Rubilar who was found less than four hours later. She was located in the Newlands area. She was unharmed. Mdlalose will remain in custody and appear in court next month. The Mercury
