Jithin Ramjaewan, of Phoenix, made a brief appearance in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. He was arrested and charged with killing Dhanwathie Fakira, 79. She was found battered and stabbed in her Arcot Place home on November 25. State prosecutor Vishalin Moodley said crucial information had come to light and had to be investigated. “The leads may affect the outcome of the bail application.” Fakira was found lying on her bedroom floor with stab wounds to the face, neck, and hand. Relatives who had arrived at the pensioner’s home shortly after the attack, told POST she had revealed the name of her killer before taking her last breath. She was declared dead by paramedics at the scene. Ramjaewan was arrested on the same day. He is expected to make a formal bail application on January 15. Fakira’s daughter, Mala Sewnarayan, said: “We understand this new information can help with the case but we are irritated with the delay.” She said her mother had been the “rock of our family” and did not deserve such a terrible death.
