Durban - The National Prosecuting Authority needs to look at harsher sentences for drunk driving. That's the view of Metro police spokesperson Parbhoo Sewpersadh who said that between Friday and Sunday 100 people were arrested by Metro police for drunk driving. "These numbers are far too high. We are only in the first week of the year." Sewpersad said that from January 2018 until December 2018, 6000 people were arrested for drunk driving by Durban Metro alone. "This does not include arrests done by RTI and SAPS." He said while he did not have the exact numbers from the previous year, the numbers had definitely increased. "This behaviour is evidence that certain road users have no regard for the rules of the road. People are not adhering to using taxi services when they consume alcohol and rather take a risk and get behind the wheel." Sewpersad there has also been a large number of females arrested for drunk driving. "In addition, people are consuming alcohol while driving either in polystyrene cups or glasses. "We also find that people are trying to swap drivers before approaching the road block. In these cases we arrest both drivers." Daily News
