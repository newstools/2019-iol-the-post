Durban - Stanley Currie, the Irishman who went missing in South Africa last month, has been found. He was found in Edenvale, Johannesburg on Monday. SACCW’s chief executive, Steven King, said Currie was found resting under a tree. “He was taking a break from the sun. He is obviously not used to our weather conditions. He was taken to a doctor for a check-up but as far as we know, he was not injured. From what he told the team who located him, he had lost his way back to where he was staying in Johannesburg,” King said. He said he did not know when King would be going back home. Currie left his home in Dublin in December in the hopes of meeting a woman he befriended on social media.  His brother, Richard Currie, said he boarded a plane using a one-way ticket, without booking accommodation, to meet a woman in Johannesburg. According to Richard, his family did not know anything about the woman their brother was supposed to meet. He added that the Currie family feared that their brother had fallen prey to an online scam. Richard said numerous attempts had been made to contact him, but his phone has been turned off. The Currie family has since thanked the community, local organisations and police for assisting in the search for their relative. The Mercury
