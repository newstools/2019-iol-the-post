Durban -Â Police have called on medical facilities to be more vigilant after patients and staff at three doctor surgeries in Phoenix were robbed in a period of ten days. In the latest robbery in Lenham Drive a doctor, his receptionist, security guard, and 8 patients were held at gunpoint on Tuesday afternoon. Gareth Naidoo from KZN VIP security said one of the suspects, armed with an Okapi knife came into the surgery on the pretense of being a patient. "He made his card and told the receptionist he was going to get money. He then distracted the security guard by asking for directions to the nearest ATM. "Seconds later his two accomplices, armed with guns, held up the guard." Naidoo said suspects took the guard into the surgery. "One suspect robbed the patients of cash, cellphone, and jewellery. The other two robbed the receptionist and doctor before fleeing the scene on foot." Last week two surgeries, one in Westham and Whetstone came under attack. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said all three incidents were reported and cases of robbery were opened. She urged doctors and patients to be more vigilant. POST
