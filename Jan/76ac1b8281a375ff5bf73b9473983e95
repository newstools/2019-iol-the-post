The ensemble stand-up comedy show will stage at the Suncoast Globe and is known to feature some of South Africa’s most popular talent. POST caught up with Govender to find out what other developments she had planned. “The plan is to collaborate with my son Kamz (Govender), aka ‘The Punny Monkey’, as we are the only known local mother/son comedy duo and we have great chemistry together so why not?” she said. And by the sound of it, her 2019 performance calendar is already heating up. “There are plans for a tandem show with Kamz. We’re just working on concepts at the moment. More immediately, I’ll be at Hotshots in Tongaat on February 22.” Govender is also well known for her cooking skills, and recently launched her own cook-in curry paste, an indication that her other career is also taking off. “I’m perfectly happy with juggling both as I’m as passionate about following my soul’s purpose as I am about having families around the world, enjoy a quick, delicious, easy-to-prepare quality meal. “So we are currently transitioning from a restaurant to a food factory, and aim to meet certification standards so that our curry paste can be available to people all over the world. “More immediately, my team and I will be at the Shongweni Farmers Market on February 23, doing cooking demonstrations. They say the proof is in the tasting, so we encourage people to come and try our delicious treats at our stall.” Back to the show this Saturday, Govender said the audience could look forward to some of her new material and parodies. “And I guess Jan-* -worry is everyone’s reality. So it will be material that we can all relate to.” The All Star Comedy Jam line-up also features Joey Rasdien, Donovan Goliath, Trevor Gumbi, Darren Maule and Rory Petzer The show starts at 8pm.
