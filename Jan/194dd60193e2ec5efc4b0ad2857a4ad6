Durban -  A suspect is due to appear at the Ramsgate Magistrate's Court soon for stolen goods and attempting to stab a police dog. The 28-year-old suspect was arrested last week for stealing goods including a vehicle and a pistol. According to Colonel Thulani Zwane, the man and another - who is still at large - robbed a 58-year-old man in Lavenski Drive in Margate. “It is alleged the two males arrived in a vehicle which had a red couch on it and pretended that it required re-upholstering. While they were still inside the property another two males entered and threatened the man with firearms,” said Zwane. He added all four demanded keys to a safe and stole cash, cellphones, a flat-screen TV, laptop and a vehicle before leaving. “On the same day, police officers from the Port Shepstone K9 Unit spotted the stolen vehicle and attempted to stop the vehicle but it sped off, lost control and overturned. A suspect fled into the bushes and was chased by police officers with a canine. “It is alleged that when he saw police approaching, the suspect withdrew a knife and attempted to stab the police dog whilst threatening the police officers.” He was shot on his right lower leg and thereafter arrested. Zwane said the man is currently in a local hospital under police guard. POST
