Durban - The KZN Health MEC visited a special needs school in Umlazi to ensure they received the basic healthcare they urgently required. On Tuesday MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo together with a delegation of health experts and other department officials visited the Mason Lincoln Special School. The school situated at Umlazi V Section, caters for 335 learners who are physically challenged, visually impaired, autistic, (mild) intellectually impaired, epileptic and those living with albinism. During the visit, MEC Dhlomo found that the pupils lack a number of basic health services, and need a regular visit by a mobile clinic. “All the learners here have not had a full health assessment, which creates a basic need for that for each child. We’ve committed to come and have the children screened. And also, we’d like to advise that the school should have at least one healthcare worker who’s going to be resident here, because over 300 learners from grade R – 12 of this special category, will need someone close by to take care of their needs. “We already have a team from Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital, and eThekwini health district who will come and conduct a health screening of all the learners as of next week. They will then create a database of the learners and the challenges that they have, which I think is critical. We’re responsible for the health needs of all citizens in the country, for their screening and health needs,” he said. POST
