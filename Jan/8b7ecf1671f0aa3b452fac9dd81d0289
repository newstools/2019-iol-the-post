Durban - The two men accused of killing Durban businessman Kidesh Ramjettan appears to have abandoned their bail application. Menziwa Mdaka, 24, and  Zakhele Dubazane, 32, appeared in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Wednesday and did not apply for bail. Advocate Jimmy Howse requested that the court not proceed with the bail hearing and also asked that the State finalise their investigations. When asked by the magistrate if he was suggesting the suspects had been abandoning their bail, Howse responded that he was acting per his client's request. The matter was adjourned for February 28 for further investigations. In August Ramjettan, 37, had been talking to a customer outside his petrol station in Rossburgh when he was gunned down. The shooting was captured on CCTV. Trigger man, Ayanda Shezi was arrested two months later where Shezi pleaded guilty to the murder. He is currently serving a life sentence in prison. POST
