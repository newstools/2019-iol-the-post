Durban - Six people have been killed and two others critically injured in a serious collisionÂ on the L823 in Cato Ridge near Nagle Dam. According to Shawn Herbst from Netcare 911, paramedics responded at around 1pm. "Reports from the scene indicate that the driver of a truck transporting heavy earth moving machinery lost control after rolling back resulting in a rollover. "Medics assessed the scene and found that the occupants of a bakkie and car became trapped when the truck and earth moving equipment came down on top of them. "Fire and Rescue Services as well as the Netcare 911 Rapid Specialised Extrication Unit had to use the Jaws of Life to free many of the trapped. "Six people were assessed and found to have no signs of life and declared deceased on the scene," said Herbst. He said due to the nature of two of the patients who had sustained critical injuries the Netcare 5 specialised helicopter ambulance as well as another private helicopter ambulance was called to the scene to airlift patients to hospital.
