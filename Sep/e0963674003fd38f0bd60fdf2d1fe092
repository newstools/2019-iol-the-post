Durban - A Tongaat Secondary teacher charged for statutory rape of a pupil is expected to apply for bail in the Verulam Magistrate's Court. The teacher who cannot be named until he pleads, was arrested on Monday and made his first appearance in court. He was remanded in police custody. The 31-year-old is alleged to have engaged in sexual activity with a minor pupil. On Monday, State prosecutor, Winnie Mlangeni said the state intended opposing bail due to the seriousness of the case. The accused is being represented by Advocate Niven Rai. Speaking outside court Rai told POST he was certain his client would be released on bail. "We are fully confident that after evidence is tendered and arguments are done, that we will show that the accused person is a suitable candidate to be released on bail," said Rai. On September 9, parents, pupils and members of Child Welfare protested outside the school demanding the removal of the teacher. They held up banners that read: “Say no to physical, sexual abuse” and “When you see something, say something.” Later that day, the teacher was suspended pending an investigation by the Department of Education on allegations of sexual misconduct. Kwazi Mthethwa, spokesperson for the education department, said it distanced itself from any sexual harassment or abuse, and would not hesitate to act against any sexual offenders within the education sector.
