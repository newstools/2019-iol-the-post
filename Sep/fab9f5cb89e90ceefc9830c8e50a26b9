Durban - KZN police have issued a stern warning to those who open false cases saying they would act decisively. This comes after a man allegedly reported his vehicle stolen when he in fact allegedly gave it to his friend. "It is alleged that the man reported that his vehicle was stolen from Sanele Nxumalo Road in Tongaat. Police officers commenced with an investigation which led to the recovery of the stolen vehicle in Cato Manor, within an hour after it was reported stolen," said Colonel Thembeka Mbhele Mbele said police arrested the driver of the vehicle, aged 33. He was immediately charged theft of the motor vehicle and made a first appearance in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court. Mbele said the case was adjourned for further investigation. "However police interviewed the owner of the vehicle and quickly realised that his story was not above-board. "It is alleged that he handed over the vehicle to his friend as he could not afford to pay the installment on the vehicle. He was immediately arrested and charged for defeating the ends of justice." Mbele warned the public against wasting valuable police resources. "Resources are being wasted to investigate 'crimes' that did not occur. Despite police arresting and charging people previously for opening false cases, the trend still continues." POST
