Durban - A Tongaat Secondary teacher charged with statutory rape of a pupil has been released on R3000 bail. The 31-year-old man who cannot be named, was arrested on Monday and made a second appearance in the Verulam Magistrate's Court today. It is alleged that the teacher had been exchanging messages of a sexual nature with a Grade 11 pupil. It was her parents who opened the criminal case against the teacher. On September 9, parents and pupils protested outside the school demanding the removal of the teacher. The KZN Department of Education suspended the teacher pending an investigation. According to the department spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa,the male teacher had allegedly been caught out exchanging graphic material through WhatsApp messages. These include photos and text messages. He said sexual abuse has been as much a constant feature of South African schools as it has been of society in general. "Many of our schools have become violent and unsafe environments, particularly for the girl-child. It is a matter that requires urgent attention from all sectors of the society." POST
