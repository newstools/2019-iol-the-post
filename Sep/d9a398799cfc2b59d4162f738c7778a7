Durban - Members of a "make shift" rescue team have been hailed after they managed to rescue a puppy that had fallen into a drain on Monday afternoon. Frantic messages circulated in Facebook community groups after the puppy was heard crying in the drain in Montclair. Community member Greg Albert said when he received the alert, he contacted Leon Fourie from Life Response 24. "Within minutes we were on our way to rescue the pup. The puppy had managed to go down a drain and into the pipe and got stuck approximately 12-metres down the pipe which was covered in thick concrete," he said. With the help of staff from Drainmed, they were able to locate the distressed puppy using a high tech camera system. "What followed next was amazing," said Albert. Along with officials from eThekwini Fire and other teams from a Just In Time Plumbing, Pro Tech Guarding, Crow and residents, teams managed to dig up concrete in a bid to get to the puppy. After more than two hours, the little dog was rescued and local vet, Dr Govender, was on hand to ensure that he was ok. "We are so grateful and would like to thank everyone involved in the rescue," Albert said.           The Mercury
