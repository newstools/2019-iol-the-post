Durban - A 21-year-old man who raped his 12-year-old neighbour and thereafter threatened her with a knife has been jailed for life. The man was convicted in the Kokstad Regional Court this week. According to KZN police the child had been sent to a nearby tuckshop in Kokstad on June 15, 2017, when she was approached by the suspect who is her neighbor. "He took her to his room where she was raped. He further threatened her with a knife that she must not tell anyone about the incident," said Colonel Thembeka Mbele. Police said a case of rape was later opened at Kokstad police station for further investigation. "Through hard work by detectives, the accused was immediately arrested and charged with rape." He appeared in court several times and he was eventually found guilty. Earlier this month Nicholas Ninow was found guilty on two counts of rape. The 21-year-old confessed to raping a seven-year-old girl in the ladies' bathroom the Dros restaurant in September 2018. POST
