Durban - An EEG technician charged with the rape of an in-patient at Chatsmed Hospital has been released on R3 000 bail. The man who cannot be named until he pleads, because he faces a rape charge, appeared in the Chatsworth Magistrate's Court on Monday. According to a source not authorised to speak to the media, the 22-year-old man who lives in Phoenix, had been attending to the 17-year-old patient in August. It is alleged that the minor was alone in the ward at the time and the man allegedly drew the curtains and raped her. She reported the matter to police and he was subsequently charged. As part of his bail conditions the man is not allowed to see a patient unchaperoned and has to inform the investigating officer every time he sees a patient. The matter was adjourned to November for further investigations. Earlier today Nicholas Ninow pleaded guilty to the rape of a 7-year-old girl in the toilet at the Dros restaurant in Silverton inÂ September. The trial got underway in the North Gauteng Court. POST
