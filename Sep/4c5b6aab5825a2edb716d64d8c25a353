Durban - A newborn baby was found on a first-floor balcony outside a building in Church street, Pietermaritzburg CBD a day ago. According to ER24 spokesperson Werner Vermaak paramedics arrived on scene shortly before 11am and found the Police’s Search and Rescue team already on the scene. "They were escorted to the first floor. Outside a window on the balcony the baby boy was found with no signs of life. It appeared as if the baby had been on the balcony for some time. "The scene was handed over to the police for further investigation. The exact circumstances surrounding the incident is not known to paramedics." Police have been approached for comment and have not responded as yet. This year there have been a number of abandoned babies in the Durban area. A Newlands mother who abandoned her baby in a stormwater drain in January has been granted bail of R5000. In a separate incident a Verulam mother who dumped her baby on the side of the road to be picked up by waste services, was given a suspended sentence and correctional supervision. Another Verulam mother was charged for child abandonment after she was caught on CCTV abandoning her child outside a restaurant in the Verulam CBD. POST
