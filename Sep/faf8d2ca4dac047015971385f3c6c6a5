Durban - Police have confirmed a case of murder has been opened after the decomposed body of a 77-year-old woman was found in Bluff. According to Metro spokesperson Parbhoo Sewpersad, the victim was found with her hands tied and showed signs of being strangled. Sewpersad said members from Durban Search and Rescue responded to the scene in Grafton Road, Bluff just after midnight on Tuesday. He said the woman's body was found in her house. "It is believed that she had two men living with her who indicated that they would renovate her home for her," said Sewpersad. It was her neighbours who raised the alarm when they did not see her for a few days. According to Sewpersad the woman was struck by a blunt object and her body was wrapped in a carpet and placed in a bathtub. He added that the suspects tried to set the woman alight and fled the scene thereafter. Police are still searching for the two males in questions. "A case of murder has been opened at Brighton Beach SAPS for investigation." POST
