Durban -Ravi Pillay, the KZN MEC for Finance was sworn in as the acting premier of KwaZulu Natal on Tuesday morning. Premier Sihle Zikalala together with leader of government business Nomusa Dube-Ncube are embarking on a three-day trade and investment mission in Egypt. "The mission starts on Wednesday and concludes on Friday," said Bongani Tembe, premier spokesperson. Tembe added that Premier Zikalala attended the brief swearing in ceremony conducted by KZN Judge President Achmat Jappie in Durban.  Tembe said it was a "norm" to appoint an acting Premier when the Premier is away on official business. "The acting premier will assume the duties done by the Premier," said Tembe. In this case, it will end on Friday. This is not the first time Pillay has acted as Premier. In March 2018, Pillay became the first Indian premier for the province, albeit in an acting capacity. Pillay told POST of the historic appointment: “It is all about uniting people and building the country. Although I will be in the position for a few days, it shows the institution has confidence in me to man this position and make whatever necessary changes if need be." POST
