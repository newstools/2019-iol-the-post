Moti Bikshu, 58, a Pietermaritzburg businessman who was referred to as “Mr Motech”, was allegedly assaulted in July and had been hospitalised until his death. His wife, Angeline, runs a catering business and while at a function, an argument ensured with an employee. Angeline said he suffered bleeding on the brain and underwent an emergency brain operation. “I was not present when the incident happened, but I was told there was an argument and he was assaulted. My husband fell and he managed to get up. He did not show signs of injury, until the next morning.” Bikshu underwent a CT scan and was told he needed to undergo an operation to prevent clotting. The operation was a success, but Bikshu ended up having two heart attacks post-surgery, she said. “He was transferred from Durban to a hospital in Pietermaritzburg. While he was unable to speak, he was in a stable condition.” She said she wanted the person responsible for her husband’s death to be held accountable. “My husband would never have been in this situation if he had not been assaulted The law needs to take its course.” Angeline said her husband won many drag racing titles and trophies over the past three decades. The family is awaiting the post-mortem results. The police confirmed an inquest and common assault case was being investigated. POST
