Durban - Three lanes on the N3 have been closed to traffic after a truck caught alight a short while ago near the Pavilion off-ramp. According to Garrith Jamieson from Rescue Care Paramedics, the Durban Fire Department is currently on scene trying to extinguish the blaze. He said they received a call around 9:30am. "Three lanes and the emergency lane are currently closed while emergency workers are busy on the scene. At this stage it appears there are no injuries."  He said the driver managed to escape. Jamieson said the truck appeared to have been carrying no goods. He said traffic was badly affected and urged motorists where possible to delay their trips or use alternate routes. "It could take another hour or so for the clean-up operation," said Jamieson. He said paramedics are however on standby. Updates to follow. Last month aÂ truck driver sustained moderate injuries after his truck overturned and caught alight on the M7, heading towards Bluff. POST
