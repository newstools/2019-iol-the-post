My assumption is that two to three million women in SA are beaten in their homes, annually, by their husbands, ex-husbands or partners. One in every 20 women will experience domestic violence. An estimated 1.3million women are victims of physical assault, by an intimate partner, each year. About 85% of domestic violence victims are women. Some women get assaulted and are abused for trivial reasons. Men are physically stronger and that is why they take advantage of women. Some cases of domestic violence are not reported, as women fear their partners. I suggest that women, who are being abused, speak to marriage counsellors and the police. Abuse happens among people of all ages, socio-economic classes, occupations, and educational backgrounds. A battering incident is rarely isolated.  POST
