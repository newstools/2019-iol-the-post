Our country was once an abode of high morality and ethical standards and it is, unfortunately, diving towards a state of moral waywardness. Bribery will never be unearthed, contained or eradicated. It is an integral part of our complex political DNA. Bribery and corruption must be classified as treason. This will create fear in the culprits and it will provide momentum for a just and good society. The NPA is a toothless tiger. And it is evident that the Hawks do not possess the requisite legal skills to prosecute and win complex cases of corruption. Eventually, the State will have to seek legal assistance from Bar council lawyers to move the volume of cases waiting to be investigated and brought to the high courts. Basking in legal limbo will reduce our country to a Mafia-style failed state.  POST
