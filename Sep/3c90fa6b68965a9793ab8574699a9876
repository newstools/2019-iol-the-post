The man, who cannot be named until he pleads, appeared in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court last week. He was released on R1 500 bail. It is alleged he raped the staff member in August. The circumstances leading up to the alleged rape is not yet clear. The company’s spokesperson said since being made aware of the allegation on September 13, its board of directors offered the employee counselling. “In light of the seriousness of the allegation that was levelled against him, the directors suspended him pending a formal hearing and the outcome of the criminal case. “The company and its directors view any wrongdoing or transgressions of the law by any staff member in their employ in a very serious light and will co-operate fully with any criminal investigation initiated in this regard, more so if the allegations involve any offence against women - and especially children.” He said the company pledged its support to the victim and no stone would be left unturned in bringing the suspect to book. “We will continue to enforce the law without fear or favour and will act against our own if and when necessary.” The case was adjourned to next month.
