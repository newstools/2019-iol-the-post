Durban - Police have issued a warning to the community not to fall prey to any scams involving the depositing of money into a policeman's account. Police have been receiving a number of complaints from the community of a man who calls himself Captain Khumalo. The said bogus captain allegedly phones persons that have opened criminal cases, claiming that he has recovered their stolen vehicles or stock said Colonel Thembeka Mbele, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson. He will then request that the complainant deposit a certain amount of money into various accounts. He promises complainants that he will arrange for the stolen items to be returned to them after receiving the requested money. He is also known to call relatives of arrested persons with a promise to speak to prosecutors and arrange bail for suspects, if he is paid a certain sum of money. "The police would like to take this opportunity to notify the community that if their stolen goods are recovered, the investigating officers will always contact them. Complainants will always be requested to come to a police station with their identify documents to claim recovered goods. Police will not request cash for any reason during the cause of an investigation. If in doubt, complainants are requested to always consult with the detectives investigating their cases,"Mbele said.
