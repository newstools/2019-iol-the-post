Durban-  The Durban Metro Police was hot button topic at the eThekwini executive council meeting when it was revealed that the city's ratepayers were going to pay nearly a quarter billion rand towards overtime this year. In the executive committee agenda that was tabled at an Exco meeting on Wednesday revealed that the overtime for Durban Metro Police expenditure was anticipated to be about R230 million for the year. The Democratic Alliance's executive council member, Thabani Mthethwa, expressed concern at the large overtime by the police. “We are sitting in trouble,” he said. This comes as the report noted how Metro police had a 660.53 percent increase in overtime. Other departments like the Expanded Works Programme also saw huge increases. The report said the EPWP was expected to be R222 million per annum -  this was against a budget of an original budget of R97 million. Krish Kumar, City Treasurer, said it had to be understood that the police had to work overtime as they dealt with social delivery issues like land invasion and the generally hostile political climate. “It is on the radar and is something that we need to monitor,” he said. Mxolisi Kaunda, eThekwini mayor said the amount of overtime Metro police had was something that needed to be addressed. He said the issue of land invasions and protests which led to the overtime by Metro Police needed to be addressed by the city. Daily News
