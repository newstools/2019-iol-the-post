Alan Paton joined the Liberal Party of South Africa when a 19-year-old student at the University of Natal in Pietermaritzburg. His iconic novel Cry, the Beloved Country was published in 1948 - ironically the very year in which apartheid was formally institutionalized. He was banned in 1965 for 10 years because of his exposures of forced removals of rural African people from their land. Political Bureau and Studio Independent
