Durban - Reaction Unit SA has had its licence suspended. However RUSA boss Prem Balram assured the community that services would remain uninterrupted as a sister company took over the operation. Balram said his attorney Godfrey Pillay from Godfrey & Associates Incorporated in Tongaat planned to appeal this decision in a higher court. In June RUSA was suspended by the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (PSIRA) for alleged misconduct. Less than a day later they sought an urgent interdict in the Durban High Court and were victorious. The matter was heard in July and judgment was delivered on Friday in the Durban High Court. The judge ruled that their licence be suspended and that PSiRA should hear the appeal. PSIRA said they were thorough in its investigation and this immediate suspension is sustained until the finalisation of the Code of Conduct findings. PSIRA spokesperson Siziwe Zuma explained that according to Section 28 of the Code of Conduct any person convicted of misconduct may be liable to a fine or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding 24 months.
