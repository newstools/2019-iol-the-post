The State did not have sufficient evidence to prosecute the 57-year-old father of two. Last month, the pastor was arrested after the woman, 26, accused him of raping her. He was granted R3000 bail at the time. His legal representative, advocate Niven Rai, said the ordeal was taxing on the pastor and his family. “Inasmuch as we were confident of our success in this matter, had it gone to trial, it is still a relief that the truth has prevailed so early in the proceedings. “Those who were aware of the charges were also aware of the pastor’s character. “They were confident there was more to this allegation than met the eye.” In his first appearance it was revealed the pastor knew the complainant since 2016 and their relationship soured. Rai said: “The woman was not his lover but more of a close family friend who the family had known for many years.” POST
