Durban - The case against law graduate Nekita Sukdeo, who is accused of stabbing her father, has been adjourned to later this month for further investigation. The 23-year-old murder accused was released on warning after a brief appearance in the Alexandra Magistrate’s Court. It is alleged she stabbed her dad, Jewan, 43, a truck driver, in the chest, while he and her mother, Nadira Lutchmana, were arguing on July 13. He died en route to the Sunnyhill Hospital. Sukdeo and her brother, 16, lived with their parents in a cottage on the grounds of the Iskcon (International Society for Krishna Consciousness) ashram in Sandton. Lutchmana was a devotee at the ashram. POST has previously reported that according to a family member, the couple had a history of quarreling. “From what we know, there was a quarrel between Jewan and Nadira on Saturday morning. “During the dispute, Nekita got involved and the situation between her and her father became tense. From what we hear, she reached for a kitchen knife and stabbed him.” POST
