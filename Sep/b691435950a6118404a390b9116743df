Durban - Tuesday marks a year since Miguel Louw's decomposed body was found in Phoenix. The 9-year-old's body was found in a vacant land in Longbury Drive. To mark the one year anniversary, his family will plant a tree at Rippon Road Primary School to honour his memory. Miguel's aunt Tashnim dos Santos said they decided to plant a tree because it is Arbour Month. "We take each day as it comes. It been very rocky especially with Miguel's dad passing away." Next month, 43-year-old Mohamed Vahed Ebrahim, who is accused of Miguel's kidnappping and murder will stand trial in the Durban High Court.  In a two-page indictment, the State alleges that Ebrahim who lives in Longbury Phoenix occasionally lived at Miguel's home in Sydenham and performed odd jobs around their home. It further states that prior to the incident, Ebrahim and Miguel's mother had an argument. "As a result, the accused decided to kill the deceased in order to exact revenge on the deceased's mother," said the State in the indictment. Ebrahim denied any involvement in the murder during his bail application and he remains in police custody. Dos Santos encouraged those who wanted to attend her nephew's commemoration to wear blue as it was Miguel's favourite colour. POST
