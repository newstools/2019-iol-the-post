Durban - The alleged kingpin involved in the Durban terror attacks in 2018 will be allowed to travel to China on business. Farhad Hoomer appeared in the Verulam Family Court on Monday. His bail is set at R200 000. NPA spokesperson Natasha Ramkisson-Kara confirmed Hoomer's bail conditions have been relaxed. "The accused asked for relaxation of bail conditions, as he needs to travel to China for business." Ramkisson-Kara said the State considered his requests and granted the relaxation with the following conditions: -        Hoomer must travel to China only; and only for business. -        He can only travel for 7 days at a time. -        He must hand in his flight details and itinerary in advance to the investigating officer. Another bail condition that has been relaxed that instead of all 12 accused reporting to a police station once a week, they would have to report to a police station once in two weeks. Hoomer and 18 others were arrested in September 2018, following a spate of bomb attacks in an around Durban; and a mosque in Verulam that claimed the life of Abbas Essop. Charges against seven were dropped while the 12 were released on bail and some on a warning. Hoomer will back in court alone on October 16 for arguments pertaining to his voice samples.
