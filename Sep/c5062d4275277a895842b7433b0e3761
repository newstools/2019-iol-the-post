Sugen Naicker, 36, faces seven counts of fraud amounting to R594 000. During his previous court appearance, Naicker, through his attorney, advocate Niven Rai, said he intended on pleading guilty. However, the Chatsworth resident had a change of heart. This resulted in Rai withdrawing as his attorney. He said he was ethically bound to withdraw from the case. Naicker assured the court that on his next appearance, he would have a new legal representative. He has been in police custody since April. Those who have accused him of fleecing them out of their money were unhappy by the turn of events. Some said Naicker had ruined their lives. One man claimed he invested R10 000 that was meant to pay off his two children’s school fees. “My wife does not even know what I did.” Another man, who invested R174 000, claimed Naicker told him they could start a joint business venture. And he believed him. A few weeks after investing, he realised he had been duped. A single mother claimed she invested R156000 with Naicker to buy a repossessed vehicle. “I know his family. We attend the same church and I trusted him. I only opened a case against him after I came to terms with what happened.” The case was adjourned to next month. POST
