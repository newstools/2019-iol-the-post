Durban - Four teenagers, arrested for the murder of a classmate last week, are expected to apply for bail at their next court appearance. The teens, aged between 13 and 16 are due back in court on Friday. Police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said the boys were arrested by police officers from Berea SAPS last week after they allegedly shot and killed their schoolmate, 16-year-old Moyeni Walters.  "It is alleged that the deceased had a fight in school with one of the accused the previous day. On the following day, while Walters was walking home along Warwick Avenue, he was shot in the abdomen by the accused. He was taken to hospital where he later succumbed to his injury," she said. Gwala said the firearm was not found in the possession of the accused and they claimed that an unknown man who was driving a taxi spotted them fleeing the scene with the firearm and took it. The licenced firearm belongs to the late step-father of one of the accused. Berea detectives followed up information and their investigations led them to Ndwedwe where the pistol and ammunition was found hidden in the roof of a home. A 26-year-old suspect was arrested for defeating the ends of justice and unlawful possession of a firearm. He is due to appear in court soon. The Mercury
