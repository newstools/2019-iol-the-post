Durban - The case against murder accused Ashen Vishnudath, who escaped from the Westville Prison last month, was struck off the roll in the Pinetown Magistrateâ€™s Court on Thursday. Due to him failing to appear, the case was struck off until his arrest. The Reservoir Hills mechanic, 27, was accused of killing Navendren Govender, 30, who intended buying a car from him. Govender, 30, was reported missing on March 6. His body was found in the bushes in Mariannhill hours later. He sustained three gunshot wounds to the head. Vishnudath had been in police custody since March. He conjured up an elaborate plan to escape from Westville Prison by posing as an inmate, who was granted bail. Vishnudath roped in two others to pay the R300 bail and walked free. Sudeshan Govender, 34, and Tashlin Joel Israel, 27, who were arrested and charged with defeating and obstructing the ends of justice are expected to apply for bail. POST
