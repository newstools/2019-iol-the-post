NEWS - HOPING to add a spring to your step The Enchanted Gardens is hosting its Spring Music Festival and Dance Party on Sunday. “It’s springtime and at the moment there is a lot of doom and gloom around us, with the economy and politics in the country, so we wanted to bring spark back to the community,” explained organiser Siva Naidoo. But he said the event - which will feature bands such as Main Ingredient, Crescendos, Platinum Heat, Men In Black and more - was also about celebrating local talent. “We are all about supporting local. Local music will never die. Some of these bands have been around for many years, since the days of dance, at the likes of the Island Hotel, Athlone Hotel, and others. “When international artists come down we’re expected to cough up a lot of money for brief shows. “Why not support our local artists and relax in a truly home-grown atmosphere?” Naidoo said they were passionate about the 1980s culture of good music and good vibes, adding that most of the bands were from the community. “Main Ingredient are a relatively new band of seasoned musicians from Chatsworth. “Crescendos have a long history, spanning more than 60 years, and having played at almost every club and hotel in the city.” The Spring Music Festival and Dance Party will take place on September1.
