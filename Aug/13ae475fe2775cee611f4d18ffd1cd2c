Durban - Former KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Vincent Mdunge, has been released on parole. Mdunge’s parole placement was officially confirmed by the Department of Correctional Services on Tuesday. DCS spokesperson, Singabakho Nxumalo, said Mdunge was a first time offender and a positive support system has been put in place. He said this is in line with Section 73 of the Correctional Services Act, which determines the minimum periods of sentence that must be served before consideration may be given to possible placement. “He participated in relevant correctional programmes and was further assessed by our special services experts, which amongst others include, social workers and psychologists in order to determine his suitability for parole placement,” Nxumalo said. He said Mdunge will complete the remainder of the sentence in the system of community corrections, and must comply with specific set of conditions and will be subjected to supervision until the sentence expires. Mdunge was found guilty on charges of fraud and forgery in 2014 after he produced a fake Grade 12 certificate that secured him a promotion and helped to advance his career within the SAPS. In 2015, Mdunge was sentence but he appealed the sentence and only began serving jail time in August 2017. His sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court of appeal. Mdunge appeared in court earlier this year, where he applied to have his sentence converted to correctional supervision. The Mercury
