Durban - About 15 children from Effingham Primary School in Durban are currently being for symptoms of gas inhalation. According to Shawn Herbst from Netcare 911 they were called to scene after the kids from one classroom complained of chest pains, difficulty in breathing and a burning sensation in their mouth, nose and throat. Some were also coughing. According to Herbst from preliminary investigations there is nothing in the school that caught alight. "In addition there are no factories near the school. "However the Durban Fire Department and other emergency services are currently on scene trying to determine the cause of gas inhalation." Herbst said they were called to scene just after 9:44am. He said when they arrived the principal had activated the emergency plan and all pupils were taken to a safe, ventilated area and various emergency services and parents were notified. He said it appears that only one classroom and the teacher were affected. Herbst said all affected patients would be transported to various hospitals for further care. POST
