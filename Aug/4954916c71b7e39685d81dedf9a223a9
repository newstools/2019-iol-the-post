Durban -  Hindus are all over the world will celebrate Krishna Janmashtami on Friday. According to Ashwin Trikamjee, President of the South African Hindu Maha Sabha, it is a celebration of Lord Krishna's birth event. The date varies every year and falls on the 8th day of the Hindu calender. Krishna is recognized as an Avatar of God and he came in the form of a human being, Trikamjee explains. "When there is strife and negativity Krishna restores people's belief in God." Trikamjee said most people fast and observe a vigil at the temple. "There is a celebration and singing of Lord Krishna songs and the actual celebrations take place a midnight. "Sometimes there is a re-enactment of a birth scene celebrating Lord Krishna's birth." The Hare Krishna Temple in Chatsworth will observe this festival with music, dance, drama and spiritual discourse. A special midnight arati (worship) will be observed tonight. The festival continues at the temple on Saturday with the observance of the appearance anniversary of the Founder of the Movement, His Divine Grace A.C Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. POST
