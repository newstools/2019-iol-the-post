Durban -  A Phoenix man who allegedly duped an elderly woman into handing over her gold thali (sacred marital string) decided not to plead guilty. Ronaldo Chetty, 30, of Clayfield, faced 10 counts of fraud.   He is alleged to have defrauded a number of elderly victims. His attorney Keshlin Naidoo told the court, that his client disputed some of the counts and had indicated constitutional rights infringement. "I had spoken to my client this morning, he did not think it was in the best interest to plead guilty an requested the matter proceed to trial." Naidoo on placed on record that he was withdrawing as his attorney. Chetty, who opted not to appoint a Legal Aid represented, was given until August 14 to obtain new representation. Chetty was arrested in 2018, after he allegedly conned a 72-year-old senior citizen into handing over the 50-year-old thali worth R50 000, a cellphone and R700 cash. Following his arrest, other alleged victims came forward. Chetty allegedly conned an elderly man,77, into handing over R2500 for a parcel and an elderly woman,72, of R200 and three gold bangles in 2018. Another victim,75, had allegedly given him R1500 for “computer stuff” that he needed for her son. He is alleged to have used the modus-operandi of knowing the victim's children. Chetty was remanded back into prison custody. POST
