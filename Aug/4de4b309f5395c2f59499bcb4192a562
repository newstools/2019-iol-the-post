Durban - A suspect who allegedly knocked a police officer who had been flagging him to stop, has been charged for attempted murder and reckless and negligence driving. According to KZN police officers from Public Order Police Unit were conducting crime prevention operations at Umsunduzi when they attempted to pull over a vehicle that was approaching them. "Police officers flagged down the vehicle and indicated to the driver to stop," said Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane. "It is alleged that the driver refused to stop and struck a police officer in the process as he attempted to evade police. The suspect fled in his vehicle and police officers gave chase." Zwane said the suspect was eventually apprehended as he stopped at his father’s homestead. "When the police officers arrested the driver, he initially resisted attempts to arrest him. The police officers were required to use force to overpower him so that he could be placed under arrest." He also faces charges for failing to stop after being instructed to by a police officer as well as resisting arrest. The suspect is expected to appear in the Camperdown Magistrate's Court today. In January this year Durban metro police officer Inspector Johan Deysel was killed when he tried to stop a taxi. The incident took place in Amanzimtoti, south of Durban. POST
