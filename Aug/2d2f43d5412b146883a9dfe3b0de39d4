Durban - The Department of Health said that the faulty lifts at Addington Hospital was a result of an overflowing water tanker which flowed into the lift shafts. Earlier on Friday emergency services in Durban were notified that Addington Hospital will not be accepting any new patients until further notice. Hlongwane said ambulances are being diverted to King Edward VIII Hospital for the next six hours while the lifts are being repaired. According to spokesperson Agiza Hlongwane, a water tank situated on top of the building overflowed due to a faulty valve, on Wednesday this week. "Due to this, the water failed to turn off and overfilled the tank. "This resulted in water flowing into the lift shafts serving the high rise portion of the building. "The service provider was called and has since been able to restore 2 of the four front lifts. They are currently working on the service lifts which have also sustained water damage." POST
