Durban - A man, believed to be in his 50s, was killed after he fell down at least several floors at a block of flats on Beach Road in Amanzimtoti on Tuesday afternoon. According to ER 24 spokesperson Russel Meiring paramedics arrived on the scene at 13h18 to find the local authorities already in attendance. "The body of the man was found lying in the courtyard of the building. "Medics assessed the man and found that he had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. Nothing could be done for him and he was declared dead." Meiring said the exact details surrounding this incident are not yet known to us but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations. Less than a week ago a construction worker had to airlifted to hospital after he fell 9 metres at a construction site in Drummond. Netcare 911 who responded to the scene said it is alleged his step ladder gave way. Medics assessed the scene and found that the patient had sustained serious injuries and required Advanced Life Support intervention to stabilise him. POST
