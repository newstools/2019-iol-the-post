Durban - Miss SA contestant Xia Narain has described the pageant as an amazing, once in a lifetime experience. And even though the 23-year-old Chatsworth beauty did not walk away with the coveted crown; she did walk away with invaluable friendship bonds. "I made such good friends in the last couple months," said Narain. On Women's Day on Friday Zozibini Tunzi was crowned Miss SA 2019 at the Sun Arena in Pretoria. Narain described her win as "so deserving." "We are all so proud of her and I wish everyone could have seen how we celebrated with her." Narain, a psychology graduate and model, said she was unsure if she would enter Miss SA again. "I however did give it my all." Narain will continue with her modelling career in a months time and next year pursue her honours degree in clinical psychology. She said she was overwhelmed with both her family and public support. "I didn't walk away disappointed, if anything I had such a good time." POST
