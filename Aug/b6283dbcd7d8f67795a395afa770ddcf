Durban - The case of a Phoenix mother who was caught on video allegedly abusing her 4-year-old daughter has been struck off the court roll. The 25-year-old and her 20-year-old boyfriend, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the child, face charges of attempted murder. In March 2018, a video of the mother stomping on and kicking the child went viral on social media. At the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Monday morning the matter was struck off the court roll because cellphone evidence is still outstanding in the case. State Prosecutor Ishara Sewnarayan advised the court that they were still waiting for cellphone evidence to be sent from their cyber crime unit in Pretoria. The case was previously adjourned for the same reason in June. Magistrate Jenny Pillay however refused to adjourn the case once more and struck the matter off the roll provisionally. The accused in the matter will be summoned to court once the cellphone evidence is retrieved. The child was left beaten and bruised and had to be hospitalized. Custody of the child was granted to the child's biological father. Part of the mother's bail conditions is that she is not allowed contact with her child. The child, however, has since started Grade R and according to a relative is doing very well. POST
