Durban - The man accused of killing a Welbedacht teenager outside a tuckshop on July 21 has been denied bail in the Chatsworth Magistrate's Court. Lungisani Cele,21, faces a charge of murder following the death of 19 year old Kyle Premlall. Magistrate J da le Ray found that Cele showed no exceptional circumstances to be released on bail. While it was previously reported that Premlall was killed for his cellphone, a source close to the investigation, who is not authorised to speak to the media, said that there seems to have been an altercation between the two a week ago. Premlall who sustained a stab wound to his chest died in hospital. Testifying during the bail application in the Chatsworth Magistrate's Court, Constable Thokozani Kanyile said Premlall was stabbed before entering through the gates of the tuckshop. Kanyile told the court the accused  first exited the tuckshop upon seeing the deceased, he had pulled out a knife and stabbed him in the chest area. The case has been adjourned to September 3 for further investigation. POST
