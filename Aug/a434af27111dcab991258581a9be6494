Durban - Paramedics who were called to treat pupils at Effingham Primary School in Durban after they complained of chest pains and difficulty in breathing said the symptoms could have been caused by pepper spray. According to Garrith Jamieson from Rescue Care Paramedics the exact substance that caused the symptoms was unknown but it is suspected that it could be pepper spray. Jamieson said about 30 children between the ages of 12 and 14 were being treated at the scene. Shawn Herbst from Netcare 911 who is also at the school said the Durban Fire Department and other emergency services were trying to determine the cause of the symptoms. He said when they arrived the principal had activated the emergency plan and all pupils were taken to a safe, ventilated area and various emergency services and parents were notified. He said it appears that only one classroom was affected. POST
