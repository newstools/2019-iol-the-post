Durban - A nanny who allegedly assaulted and strangled a three-month-old baby has been charged with attempted murder. The 23-year-old suspect remains in police custody and is expected to appear in the Umlazi Magistrate's Court soon, KZN police said. "It is alleged that the mother left her three-month-old baby girl with a babysitter while she went to work," said Captain Nqobile Gwala.  "On the evening of 14 August 2019, she found her baby with a high temperature and crying uncontrollably. "She made inquiries and discovered that the babysitter had allegedly assaulted and strangled the baby." Gwala said the mother reported the incident to Umlazi police and a case of attempted murder was opened for investigation. "The victim was immediately taken to hospital for medical attention and the suspect was arrested. Parents are urged to hire people who are skilled and have experience in child-minding. They should not hire anybody who wants a job and a thorough background must be done to prevent similar incidents as well as other related criminal acts." POST
