Jimmy’s family are apparently satisfied that the evidence presented in court has dispelled rumours that the incident was suicide or murder-related. His death has been the subject of an inquest at the Western Cape High Court since March. His sister, Renisha, confirmed they would no longer be legally participating in the inquest. “All we wanted was closure and for Ford to take accountability. We feel the evidence has shown that. Ford has also come forward and provided resolutions with our family and the other affected families. For that, we are happy.” In December 2015, Jimmy’s burnt body was found in his vehicle outside the Fairy Knowe Hotel in Wilderness. The inquest findings are expected in October. If Ford is found to be at fault, it could face culpable homicide charges. POST
