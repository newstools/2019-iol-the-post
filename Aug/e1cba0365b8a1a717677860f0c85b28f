Durban - The Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions in KwaZulu-Natal Advocate Kombisa “KK" Mbakaza charged with conspiracy to commit murder made a brief appearance in the Durban Magistrate's Court today. According to NPA spokesperson Natasha Ramkisson- Kara the mater was adjourned to September 17 for further investigations. Mbakaza was arrested in June for conspiracy to kill his estranged wife. He is out on R2000 bail. The case was initially opened in Bisho and transferred to Durban because the alleged transaction between Mbakaza and the alleged hitmen took place in Durban. The investigation is being handled by Warrant Officer Rajan Govender, Provincial Organised Crime Unit. Govender was the investigating officer in the Siam Lee and Miguel Louw murder case. It is believed that the  two hitmen have turned State witnesses and also received a payment. The wife is believed to be a Magistrate practising in the Bisho area in the Eastern Cape. POST
