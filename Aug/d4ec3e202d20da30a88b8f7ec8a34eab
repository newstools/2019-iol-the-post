Durban - A man who killed a woman he suspected of practicing in witchcraft has been jailed for life. Sibongiseni Nsimbini, 33, was sentenced this week in the Empangeni Magistrate's Court after he was found guilty of murdering 55-year-old Thandiwe Ntombela at her home. Ntombela was hacked to death with an axe and her KwaMbonambi home set alight in March 2015. Nsimbini and his accomplice Simphiwe Nsimbini, 30, were arrested the same day and remained in police custody. That same year in August 2015, Simphiwe Nsimbini, 30, pleaded guilty to the murder and was sentenced to 15 years. In his guilty plea he claimed in court that they had killed Ntombela because they suspected her of practicing witchcraft. Sibongiseni pleaded not guilty and remained in police custody throughout the duration of his trial. This week he was sentenced after being found guilty or murder and arson. He received an additional five years in prison for the arson charge. KZN police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said they welcomed the sentence as South Africa commemorates Women’s Month. POST
