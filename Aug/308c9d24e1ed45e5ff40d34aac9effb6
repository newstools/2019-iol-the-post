It is also a means of promoting diversity and social cohesion. This year, the Sari Stroll, which will be held in September and not next month as previously intended, will celebrate its 10th anniversary. The event has grown from 450 participants to more than 3000 - male and female - from different races and religions. The organiser, Kamlesh Gounden, said: “We celebrate the sari but we also use this platform to raise awareness around matters affecting women such as abuse, to leading better or healthier lifestyles.” She said male volunteers from the Advice Desk for the Abused joined the procession, dressed in saris and carrying placards advocating against women abuse. This year, the event has partnered with Lancet Laboratories which will provide a health-related exhibit. Women would be able to access basic primary health screening such as finger-prick glucose testing and blood pressure checks. Information will be available on women’s health, for example, on ante-natal testing, menopause, breast cancer and cancers affecting the reproductive tract. The Sari Stroll will take place at the amphitheatre at the Bay of Plenty. The date is yet to be confirmed. * The event is free and open to all.
