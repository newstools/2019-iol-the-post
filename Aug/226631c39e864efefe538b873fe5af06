Durban - A private security company said they were at a school on the North Coast after pupils began violently protesting because they were unhappy that the school had installed security gates outsides their classrooms. According to Prem Balram, Reaction Unit director, the pupils at the high school were unhappy about security gates being locked during class hours. Balram said inter-leading gates were installed at different blocks. "They complained that the gates restricted their right to movement and began breaking them shortly after their lunch break today." "Members of Reaction Unit South Africa were called out to the school following the violent protests. "Pupils began stoning vehicles and several vehicles have been damaged." Motorists are urged to use an alternate route until the strike is brought under control. This month a school on the South Coast had to be closed afterÂ after pupils went on strike. One of the demands pupils made is that they be allowed to smoke at designated areas before school begins. POST
