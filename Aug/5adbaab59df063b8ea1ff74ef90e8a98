Durban - In a bid to clamp down on criminal activity in KwaZulu-Natal, police have shut down two illegal shebeens. Provincial police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele said an operation was conducted by Paulpietersburg police with Firearms Liquor and Second Hand Goods Control (FLASH) police, aimed at closing illegal shebeens which contribute to criminal activities in the area. “Two illegal shebeens were closed and two fridges were confiscated. A licensed bottle store owner was charged for in-consumption and failing to close at a prescribed time. He was charged for contravening the Liquor Act. Police recovered six knives, a spear as well as a screwdriver which were found abandoned inside the bottle store, left by fleeing liquor patrons,” Mbele said. She urged liquor license owners to abide by the rules of their licenses to prevent them from being shut down. “Illegal taverns contribute a lot to assaults and robberies which leave police with unnecessary cases to solve,” she said. In a separate multi-disciplinary operation, police nabbed five illegal immigrants who were in the country without valid documentation. Mbele said the operation was conducted by police and Road Traffic Inspectorate officers at the Marianhill Toll Plaza. “A driver was arrested for driving under the influence of intoxicating substances. Suspects will appear in the Pinetown Magistrates Court soon,” she said. The Mercury
