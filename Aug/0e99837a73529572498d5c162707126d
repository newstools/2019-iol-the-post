Durban -THE man allegedly found in possession of a cellphone belonging to kidnapped businesswoman Sandra Moonsamy will remain in police custody. At the Durban Magistrate's Court on Thursday the State said that they were still unable to verify if theft accused Jerry Ogbuwany Gike, 35, was legally living in the country. Gike was arrested in the first week of July following Moonsamy's disappearance on May 30. His arrest was the first breakthrough in the case. Moonsamy, a Westville mother of two and financial at Crossmoor Transport Plant, was kidnapped at the corner of Stapleton Road and M13. This is Gike's fifth appearance in court. State prosecutor Kuveshnie Pillay said from information obtained by the State Gike had no legal status. His defence attorney argued that Gike had applied for a life partner permit in 2011 which he was still not in possession of. He said there is a document to prove his application. Gike will appear in court next Tuesday. POST
