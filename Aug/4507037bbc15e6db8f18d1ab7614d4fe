Durban -Â The man allegedly found in possession of a cellphone belonging to kidnapped businesswoman Sandra Moonsamy was granted bail moments ago in the Durban Magistrate's Court. Jerry Ogbuwany Gike, 35, who was arrested in the first week of July has been released on R5000 bail. Gike's arrest was the first breakthrough since Moonsamy's disappearance on May 30. Moonsamy, a Westville mother of two and financial at Crossmoor Transport Plant, was kidnapped at the corner of Stapleton Road and M13. Today marks 75 days since Moonsamy was last seen. This was Gike's sixth appearance in court. State Prosector Sureka Mariemuthoo told the court that from information obtained by the State, Gike had no legal status and had been living in the country illegally for about ten years at his fixed address in Musgrave. His defence attorney read out an affidavit that Gike had applied for a life partner permit in 2011 which he was still pending approval at the Department of Home Affairs. He also said that Gike was a father of two toddlers and owned a pawn shop on Point which earned him R5000. The matter has been adjourned to October 8 for further investigations. POST
