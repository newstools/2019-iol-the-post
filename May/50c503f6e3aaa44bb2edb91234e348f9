Describing herself as “proudly South African”, the 59-year-old said her aim was to return to her place of birth and share the knowledge she had acquired with other teachers. Naidoo, formerly of Durban, relocated in 2015 with her husband, Elvis, 61. A few years after they settled, her daughter Deveshni, 33, joined them. She has a diploma in journalism, but was unable to get a job. Deveshni is now working as an assistant teacher. “Life in the UAE is absolutely beautiful. “There is tolerance for all cultures. It is very safe and one can feel free to shop at 10pm. “In South Africa, the government should work for the people and not embezzle money. “Unemployment is rising. Our young children of all races are turning to drugs, alcohol and violence. They are stealing and even killing.” Naidoo said more needed to be done to resolve the issues. “If these issues are not addressed, more skilled citizens will leave.” POST
