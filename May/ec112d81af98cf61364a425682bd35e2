Durban - The third person accused of murdering British botanist couple is expected to apply for bail next week. Almost a year after abandoning his bail application 36-year-old Malawian Ahmad Mussa is expected to made a fresh bid for bail, the NPA confirmed. Mussa together with Verulam couple Fatima Patel, 27, and Sayefudeen Del Vecchio, 38, have been charged with the murder of Rodney Saunders and his wife Rachel, 63. The couple went missing in February 2018 in the Vryheid area. Rodney's body was found a month later after the disappearance. His wife was found in June 2018. The trio, who appeared briefly in the Verulam Magistrate's Court today, also face charges of kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances, theft and contravention of the country’s terrorism act. Patel and Del Vecchio are believed to have links to Isis. The couple were denied bail in June after court ruled that there was strong prima facie evidence against them. Mussa who lived on the couple's property told authorities in a statement that Patel woke him to help Del Vecchio dump the bodies of the couple off the Tugela River Bridge. "The matter was adjourned to August 19 for further investigation," said NPA spokesperson Natasha Kara- Ramkisson. Daily News
