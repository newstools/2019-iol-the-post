DURBAN - TUESDAY marked a year since Everest Heights Primary School pupil, Sadia Sukhraj, was killed during a botched hijacking. A night vigil was held last night at Marklands Secondary School to mark the anniversary of the nine-year-old’s death. Pastor Cyril Pillay, who spoke on behalf of her parents, Pastor Shailendra Sukhraj and Lorraine, said: “Her family is not doing well. Emotionally, they are still going through a lot of trauma. They are just existing for the sake of existing. “If you look at them, you can see the strain and pain in their faces, and with the court case set to resume, they are constantly reminded of the events of last year.” He said a remembrance walk to honour Sadia would take place next month in Chatsworth. Sadia had been travelling with her parents from Shallcross to her grandparents home, to drop off her then seven-month-old brother, when the accused, Sibonelo Mkhize and Siyabonga Bulose, allegedly hijacked the vehicle with her inside. Sukhraj exchanged fire with the accused to try and stop the vehicle. She was shot in the chest. Mkhize faces charges of murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances. Bulose was killed during the shootout. - POST
