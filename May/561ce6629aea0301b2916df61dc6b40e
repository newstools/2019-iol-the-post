SAPS spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said last night: “We can confirm an incident at 8.30 where a female was allegedly killed at her home in Stonebridge Drive, Phoenix. Her house was then allegedly set alight. A case of murder and arson has been opened at the Phoenix police station for investigation.” Glen Naidoo, a spokesperson for private security company KwaZulu- Natal VIP Unit, said yesterday it received a call saying a house was on fire. “When reaction officers arrived, they found the windows were closed and doors were locked. The interior of the house was filled with black smoke. “They were forced to break the door to find the source of the fire and extinguish it,” said Naidoo. The house was in disarray, he added, with clothing strewn on the floor, leaving officers suspicious. “Officers suspected foul play. “They found blood stains inside the house. “A search revealed the body of a woman in one of the rooms,” said Naidoo. Police had not yet released the identity of the woman at the time of going to press last night. Additional reporting Zainul Dawood, Daily News
