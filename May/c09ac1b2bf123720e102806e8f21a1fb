DURBAN - Voters at a voting station in Albert Falls on Wednesday reported incidents of intimidation. They said had been under siege in the run up to the elections as disgruntled community members closed the Old Greytown Road. The community members are angry over the delays in settling a land claim. On Thursday last week they again closed the road. “The land issue has been ongoing as the community is angry that the land owner first bought the land with the community living on it and he is refusing to allow for services in the area,” said an ANC activist. Last night there was talk that anyone who dares to vote “will face the consequences” this evening. He said they feared the threats may have prevented some people from voting. “The numbers are lower than we are used too at this voting station, but maybe more will come later,” he said. An IFP activist said threats had been made that the community should not vote but this was retracted after a deal was reached with the promise that the Municipal manager of Umshwathi municipality will address disgruntled community members on Friday. A presiding officer at the station who declined to be named said the voting was proceeding smoothly. Click here for more #Elections2019 stories. THE MERCURY
