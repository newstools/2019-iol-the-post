Rakesh Manohar, 49, a chemical engineer, survived the attack that took place in Berea on Friday. A suspect, 31, has been charged with attempted murder and was expected to appear in the Durban Magistrate’s Court. A spokesperson for PT Alarms, Dhevan Govindasamy, said the victim was waiting for his daughter when an altercation broke out with the alleged suspect, who was in a black BMW. “Bystanders said it was an argument over parking.” He said the suspect fled the scene but later handed himself over to the authorities. Manohar’s relative, Sameer Manohar, said: “At first, it was touch and go. He was in a critical condition and was placed in the intensive care unit. But over the weekend his condition improved and he was discharged on Sunday.” He added: “Rakesh is not a violent person and did not have a temper. He is a devout Hare Krishna and deeply religious.” Sameer said the shooting happened in daylight and anyone could have been hurt. “The area is busy with other parents fetching their children from school. The shooter posed a threat to everyone.” Police spokesperson, Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane, said a case of attempted murder was being investigated. POST
