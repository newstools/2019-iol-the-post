Durban - The bail application of the five people including two policemen accused of the murder of former SANDF officer has been adjourned until Friday. According to NPA spokesperson Natasha Kara- Ramkissoon, cross examination of the investigating officer is expected to take place. The bail application began on Tuesday and is being heard in the Verulam Magistrate's Court. Seelan Pillay, 46, was apparently torched for stealing a grass cutter from his employers. Pillay sustained third degree burns on May 10 and succumbed to his injuries two days later. Initially four people -Warrant Officer Theagen Naidoo, 45, of Phoenix SAPS, Sadhabivan Reddy, 52, and brothers, Anben Chinsamy, 46, and Sugendren Chinsamy, 30 - were arrested and charged. Another policeman Triston Pillay was later arrested. Pillay's son Durrel Singh, 27, of Sea Cow Lake, is demanding justice for his father's death. “I just cannot understand how a human being could do this to another human being," Singh told the POST Newspaper in an earlier interview.
