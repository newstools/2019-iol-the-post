Durban - A beekeeper has been hospitalised after being stung by a swarm of bees at his home in Pietermaritzburg on Wednesday afternoon. The man believed to be in his early 60's was apparently stung 80 times when he tried to unblock the entrances of the hive. The spokesperson for Midlands EMS Derrick Banks said when paramedics arrived on the scene and found the man lying face down on the ground in the garden. "In an attempt to remove the bees of his body his wife sprayed him down with water. After a quick assessment by the paramedics, they noticed that the patient had multiple stings all over his body an estimate of 80 in total." Banks said advanced life support intervention was performed on the patient by paramedics before he was transported to a nearby hospital for further medical treatment. "The patient and his family are a third generation beekeeping family and are no strangers to working with bees. The entrance to the hives were blocked up by thieves and when the patient went to unblock the entrances he was attacked by the bees." He is currently in hospital in a stable condition. POST
