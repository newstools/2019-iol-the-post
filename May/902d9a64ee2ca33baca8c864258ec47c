DURBAN - I recently, forced through circumstances, had several encounters with public service at state departments and was amazed at the high levels of lacklustre disposition and total ineffectiveness on display. At the Small Claims Court in Chatsworth, the middle-aged woman who was attending to me suddenly fell asleep as a deadly quiet spawned between us. This, as I desperately sought answers to an urgent matter. At a local state hospital and the Department of Labour, I was treated like some kind of pipsqueak – as if by assisting me, they were doing me a favour. This is the attitude of the new generation public service, normally a new breed of low-level officials, all designed to deliver a message that they are in control. They are used to dishing out sanitised, window-dressed or computerised answers and buzz around like angry bees but manufacture little honey. I will soon be making the trek to Home Affairs to apply for the new card ID and passport and to the Motor Licensing Bureau to renew my driver’s licence. I shudder to think what awaits me on these visits. POST - LETTER TO THE EDITOR
