Durban - The husband of the Phoenix mother who was found with her throat slit at their home in Stonebridge has been charged with her murder. Kasalal Singh, 40, a postman made a brief appearance in the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Thursday, following the death of Avina Singh, 40, a bookkeeper. She was found on the bedroom floor with a duvet placed over the body. Her throat was slit and she sustained severe burns wounds to her body. It is further alleged that Singh set the home on fire using engine cleaner before fleeing the scene. However four days later he handed himself over to police, at the Durban North Police Station. According to a police source, Singh had no recollection of the murder and claims he had been hijacked and was dumped in buses.
