Durban – Three people who allegedly pretended to be employees from the Department of Health and conducted a raid at a supermarket on the South Coast have been charged with fraud. According to KZN police the suspects - two men and woman aged between 34 and 38 - are expected to make their first appearance in the Port Shepstone Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. In addition to fraud charges they also face charges of extortion. According to KZN police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele the three allegedly misrepresented themselves as employees of the Department of Health on May 10. "They approached a supermarket on Nelson Mandela Drive in Port Shepstone and proceeded to check the expiry dates of various items. They allegedly further requested the storekeeper make a cash payment to them. The owner of the store then contacted the department to confirm the visit. This resulted in the three suspects fleeing in their vehicle." According to Mbele vigilant community members informed the police and they were arrested in the Hibberdene area on May 13. "A vehicle with false registration plates, reflective jackets, fraudulent documents from the Department of Health, identity cards as well as stamps found in suspect’s possession were seized. The vehicle used by the perpetrators was hired and fitted with fake department of health signage." Daily News
