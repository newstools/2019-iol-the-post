Durban - Convicted murderer Romano Naidoo was dealt a second blow this week when his application for leave to appeal his life sentence was denied in the Durban High Court. Last month Naidoo was sentenced for the 2013 murder of Phoenix man Manishvar Ramraj, 34, whom he met on Mxit. This week Durban High Court Judge Shyam Gyanda turned down Naidoo's application for leave to appeal his guilty conviction and life sentence. Ramraj was found dead in his Phoenix home wearing women's lingerie. His cellphone had been stolen. Naidoo was arrested shortly thereafter but the charges were provisionally withdrawn in 2013. Warrant Officer Rajan Govender of the Provincial Organised Crime Serious and Violent Unit, who is investigating the Miguel Louw and Siam Lee murder case was assigned to this case. Naidoo was re-arrested in 2015 and subsequently convicted. In addition to his life sentence Naidoo received an additional 15 years for robbery and 3 years for unlawful possession of firearm. All sentences will run concurrently. Maintaining his innocence Naidoo claimed during his evidence his chief that he never knew the deceased. Daily News
