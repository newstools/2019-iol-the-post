DURBAN - A reward has been offered for information leading to an arrest of the person responsible for the death of Durban musician and nature lover, Simon Milliken. The 60-year-old was found dead in the Burman Bush nature reserve in August last year.  At the time, it was reported that Milliken, a former KwaZulu-Natal Philharmonic Orchestra musician had been stabbed to death at the nature reserve. The family is offering a reward of R70 000 for information that would lead to the suspect's conviction. "This is also a call for anyone attacked or mugged in the Burman Bush reserve or surrounding area to provide information about the nature of the attack and a description of the attacker, weapons used, etc. The information you provide may help police solve crimes in the area by identifying possible suspects and the way they operate," the family said. Milliken was described as a passionate musician who loved nature. His brother, Jonathan, said Milliken grew up in Hampshire in Southern England and was captivated by the wildlife in South Africa.
