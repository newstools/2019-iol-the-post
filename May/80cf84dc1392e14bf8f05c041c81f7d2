Durban - The Gift of the Givers has offered to build 80 homes for victims of the Durban Floods in Bottlebrush, Chatsworth. Founder Imtiaz Sooliman said each house would cost in the region of R25 000 but they were waiting for the go ahead from relevant authorities. "The land must not be on a hill and it must be in a safe location, once the go ahead is given we can start tomorrow," said Sooliman. Sooliman said following the floods they have worked daily to assist those affected. Their relief aids in areas like Port Shepstone , Umlazi andÂ Broncoville, Welkom included feeding hundreds of families displaced during the flash floods and helping some rebuild their homes. The Durban floods that cost the City over R1 billion in repairs claimed 70 lives. Sooliman said they had received a number of corporate donations. This week the Willowton Group pledged R1,5 million to the organisation for their relief efforts. POST
