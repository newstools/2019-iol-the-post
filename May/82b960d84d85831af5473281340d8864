Mooninthan, 24, of Parlock, graduated cum laude, with a National Diploma in Town and Regional Planning. “My dad was my biggest supporter and we had the strongest bond. “When he died, my world fell apart.” Mooninthan said her brother, an actuary, and an aunt who lived abroad, assisted financially. She also worked part-time as a hostess at a dinner-and-dance spot in Durban. “I often took my books to work to try and complete assignments and assessments. “It was mentally and physically exhausting, but I pushed through.” Mooninthan said it was therefore difficult to describe her emotions during her graduation. “It was a feeling of overwhelming accomplishment At that moment, I knew he (her dad) would have been so proud of me.” Mooninthan is currently studying for a BTech Honours degree and she hopes to secure a government job.
