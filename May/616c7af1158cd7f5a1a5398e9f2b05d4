Durban - The pre-trial hearing in the Siam Lee murder case is expected to take place on July 29 in the Durban High Court. The accused, a 30-year-old man, who cannot be named, made a brief appearance in court yesterday holding on to crutches. The Kloof businessman faces a raft of charges related to the death and disappearance of 20 year old Lee. Lee was allegedly abducted from a Durban North property on January 4. Her body was found two days later on a farm in New Hanover burnt beyond recognition. At every court appearance sex workers protest outside the court calling for justice. Mickey Meji, co-ordinator at Embrace Dignity, a non governmental organisation that fights for the rights of sex workers, told The Daily News she felt that people with money get better treatment from the law. She also cited concerns with the delay in the start of the trial. However the court heard that this was due to State advocate Cheryl Naidu falling ill and being unable to attend court proceedings. In addition there were still outstanding witness statements and an accident report. Daily News
