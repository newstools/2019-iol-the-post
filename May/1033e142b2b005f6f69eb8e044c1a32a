Durban - A dysfunctional eThekwini municipality sewer pump station has led to a severe sewerage discharge into the Durban harbour on Friday. Nokuzola Nkowane, Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA)Acting Port Manager of Port of Durban, said they have suspended all diving operations within the Port. Angling activities are also prohibited due to a sewage discharge that poses a risk to diving personnel and marine life. "The discharge stems from the failure of pumps at the eThekwini Municipality’s Mahatma Gandhi Pump station. The municipality has taken the pumps out of commission and is currently awaiting the arrival of spare parts from overseas in order for repairs to be effected,"Nkowane said. TNPA’s environmental department is engaging with the municipality and is appealing to port users for their cooperation as the city acts to repair the pumps. "The suspension of diving will have an impact on companies using the repair quays within the port. The Port of Durban is unfortunately on the receiving end of the large volume of litter, effluent and sewage that is discharged via the storm-water reticulation system from a catchment area of over 200km in size,"Nkowane said.
