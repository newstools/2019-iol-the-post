The former SA Revenue Service (Sars) customs auditors, Pranesh Maharaj of La Mercy, and Reuben Moodley of Newlands West, were sentenced in the Durban Regional Court. The auditors initially informed the businessman in February last year that companies of which he was a director would be audited. During a follow-up meeting, Sars said, they tried to solicit a bribe of R200000 from him. According to Sars, Maharaj later contacted the businessman, asking for an advance payment of R10000, which was duly paid. But Maharaj did not inform Moodley of this arrangement, nor share the money with him, Sars said. The businessman reported the matter to police and a police trap was set up in March 2018. The accused were arrested in a bank parking lot in Kingsmead with R200000 handed over to them by the businessman. The duo was also sentenced to an additional two yearsâ€™ imprisonment, conditionally suspended for five years. Maharaj offered to repay the R10000. POST
