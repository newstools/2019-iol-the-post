Durban -  A 28-year-old man who kidnapped his ex girlfriend and raped her repeatedly is currently serving a life sentence. Bhekisisa Khumalo appeared in the Greytown Regional Court. He received life for the rape and additional five years for kidnapping. According to KZN police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, the 27-year-old victim was at her home in Tent Town in November 2018 when Khumalo demanded to enter. "He gained entrance armed with a knobkerrie." Zwane said he then kidnapped the victim and took her to his home. "He raped her several times while threatening her. A case of rape was opened at the Greytown police station and transferred to the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for investigation." Zwane said the accused was immediately arrested. "The investigating officer also presented evidence to the court that the victim had been hospitalised after Khumalo stabbed her several times," said Zwane. POST
