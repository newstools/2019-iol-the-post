Durban - A young Chatsworth man who was missing for over a week had run away from home because of personal issues, police have said. KZN police spokersperson Lt Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed that the 21 year old Moorton resident had been found at North Beach, Durban. He was reported missing on May 17 and a week later his family was still asking for assistance with tracing his whereabouts. On finding him, Zwane said : "Someone saw him and contacted his family who than contacted the police. They say he had issues at home and decided to run away," said Zwane. Speaking to POST last week his mother Reena said she had last seen her son on the morning of May 17 before leaving for work. She said her son always returned home; even after a night out with friends. "He always came home between 11pm and 1am. We are becoming increasingly worried. I haven't slept since his disappearance. His younger brother and I are very worried." She said her son was due to get married in December. When contacted for comment on his return, Reena said she was relieved and confirmed she had not spoken to her son to find out what happened as she was not well. She said he was living with relatives.
