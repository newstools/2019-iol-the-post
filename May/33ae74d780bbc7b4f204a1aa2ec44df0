Wasim Joseph Scott, 57, had returned from his morning prayer at the Lodge Grove Masjid and was walking down the driveway of Shana Court when he was shot in the head. It has been claimed he was confronted by a man known to him. The man allegedly drew a firearm, shot Scott and walked to a car parked nearby. Scott was buried later that evening. “We believe it could have been a hit because nothing was taken from him,” said Scott’s relative, Mohamed Hannif. He said Scott, a father of seven, was a supervisor at a shipping company. “People respected him because he went out of his way to help others. He was humble and made it his duty to go to mosque five times a day for prayer.” He said Scott had planned to host a family gathering at his home on Eid day. “He informed the family that he wanted to celebrate Eid in a grand style with the ones he loved.” Hannif said Scott’s wife, Sumaya Sheik, “is taking it bad. She is refusing to speak to people and is trying to deal with it in her own way”. He said the couple’s eldest son recently married. Police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said no arrests had been made. POST
