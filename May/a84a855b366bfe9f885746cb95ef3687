Durban - Voting got off to a slow start at several polling stations in Cato Manor where officials are still preparing material on Wednesday. Police thwarted an attempted protest on Mary Thipe Road (Cato Manor Road) where a group of people threw rocks and boulders into the street. The suburb has been subjected to land invasions and violent protests for more than a year. There were no reports of protests in the other suburbs like Chesterville, Wiggins and Cato Crest. More than eighty people began queueing, before the doors could open, at the Bonela Secondary School in Cato Manor. The area was rife with land grabs and recently four hundred shacks sprung up on Blinkbonnie Road causing tension in the suburb. Six police officers were deployed at the poll. A poster of the ballot sheet, both provincial and national, had been posted on the wall outside the entrance to the voting station as a guideline for voters. The IEC said 26.7 million registered voters are expected to cast their vote across the country. The record number of 76 parties contesting these elections has placed additional demands and pressures on the Commission, as well as on voters. Daily News
