Durban - One pedestrian was killed and another injured when an 8 metre wall collapsed on them at the corner of Kruger Street and Marshall Street in Johannesburg on Wednesday morning. According to Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst paramedics were called to the scene at around 9:25am. "Reports from the scene allege that a tipper truck transporting materials for recycling knocked an eight meter portion of a wall which had collapsed on two pedestrians." Herbst said one of the patients, an adult male sustained fatal injuries and was declared deceased on the scene. "The second patient, an adult female was found to have sustained moderate injuries to her lower limbs," Herbst said the woman was treated on scene and once stabilised was transported by ambulance to hospital for further treatment. SAPS were on scene for further investigation. In February three construction workers, believed to be in their 30s, died after a wall collapsed at a building site in Isipingo, south of Durban. POST
