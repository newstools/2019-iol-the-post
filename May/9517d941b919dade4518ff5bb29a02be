Durban - Gqom musician Babes Wodumo, her manager Nondu and fellow singer Tipcee escaped assault charges at the Durban Magistrates Court on Thursday when the case against them was withdrawn. The trio - whose real names are Bongekile “Babes Wodumo” Simelane, Nondumiso Simelane - Babes' sister-cum-manager and Thobeka “Tipcee” Ndaba, had been accused of assault for allegedly beating Durban woman Nelisiwe Zondi at an Umbilo guesthouse two months ago. Magistrate Jackie Jonck heard on Thursday that the trio had undergone a mediation process with Zondi, who elected to withdraw the charges. The trio was in high spirits at the carpark outside the courtroom as they took selfies with their legal representative. They were with a small entourage of about three cars, including a Golf GTI and Tipcee’s Mercedes Benz A-Class. Asked for reaction on the charges being withdrawn, Tipcee said “no comment”. Nondumiso started dancing and said there was nothing to say as the court had pronounced. “There is nothing we want to say, unless if you don't understand English or what was said inside the court,” she said. Babes Wodumo, on the other hand, burst into song, citing her controversial song with Mampintsha Khoniy’ngane lay’ndlini. In a separate matter at the Pinetown Magistrates Court, Babes Wodumo and Mampintsha have sought relationship counselling with an NGO for the assault case against her partner. She had filmed him allegedly beating her on Instagram.
