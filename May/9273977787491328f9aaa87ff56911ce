DURBAN - Despite a rocky start to the elections on Wednesday morning, police have managed to quell protests and ensure that those going to make their mark, are doing so in a safe and calm environment. Many of the Independent Electoral Commission staff are also well informed on the process of assisting voters, including those who are not voting in areas where they were initially registered. At the Durban City Hall, councillors had to assist starting off the voting process. Councillor Sharmaine Shewshanker said they assisted IEC officials in the morning but they rest of the process went smoothly. There was a large police presence outside the Durban City Hall but no incidents have been reported. The Metro Police Mounted Unit also patrolled the area. In Glenwood and Umbilo, no issues were reported. Earlier, The Mercury reported that two stations in Durban North had run out of papers. The matter has since been resolved.
