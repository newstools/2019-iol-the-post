Durban - Two voting stations in Durban North have run out of ballot papers. Democratic Alliance councillor, Pete Graham, said the stations which are at the Action Cricket Venue in Rinaldo Road and the Corovoca Primary School in Avoca had run out of ballot papers before 9am on Wednesday morning. "Both of these stations are in Ward 110 and have run out of ballot sheets. Where are the ballot sheets that they were issued? Is someone sitting and filling them in on behalf of the voters? We have escalated the issue as high as we can. But this is shocking," Graham said. He said the extra ballot sheets of 100 each have also run out and voting had come to a standstill. According to the Independent Electoral Commission, there are more than 3 000 residents registered at the voting station.  Councillor Graham said he is awaiting information from the IEC about whether or not ballot papers would be brought in. THE MERCURY
