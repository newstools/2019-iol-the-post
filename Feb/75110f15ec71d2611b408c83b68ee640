Ramsuruth said they tried to douse the flames with water but it was not working. "They then used sand that was left in the home to put out the flames. The ran out of the house and called police and neighbours for help. My mother was treated by paramedics for smoke inhalation and is in a stable condition." He said bottle pieces were found around the yard. "Apart from the doors being damaged, the hallway, some furniture, windows, and their electricity box was damaged. The home has no power."
