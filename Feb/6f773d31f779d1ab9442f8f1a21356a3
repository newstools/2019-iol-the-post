"Her involvement in this event indicates the calibre of this summit, and the strides being taken by African women. We are proud to have been selected as the host venue for the fourth  Forbes Woman Africa Leading Women Summit as this gives us an opportunity to showcase the incredible business opportunities and inviting natural beauty of the place we call home.” Methil Renuka, Managing Editor of Forbes Africa and Forbes Woman Africa also shared Zikalala's sentiments calling Campbell a global powerhouse in fashion.
