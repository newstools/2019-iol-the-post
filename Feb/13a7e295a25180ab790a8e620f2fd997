The Phoenix Taxi Association could not be reached for comment at the time of publication. Here are some comments from the Facebook post: Pamela Veerajoo: The guy who stopped the fight is the driver. He was my everyday transport and a humble man pity this guy gives him a bad name Martin Rai Naidoo: They call him Fana, always has an attitude and no ways of speaking to passengers. Riyaz Cassim: Sad part is in all this, you have to be a movie star and get hit a bit before the the person behind the camera or anyone helps you. I bet if the person filming was catching a hiding, they would be the first to post how bad the conductor is. I guess it's all about the likes and posts first before being helpful Natlien BoÃ«nne: I hope he gets fired and charged for this Vasinthee Nair: This is terrible! I hope someone had reported this? Someone took this video but nobody helped this guy? Daily News
