It does not matter whether it’s short or long; fish plaits, messy buns, voluminous curls, and braids are in. Braids can be styled in many ways to reflect various styles. Hairstyles should be pretty, classy and comfortable. Hair accessories: Accessories are chosen to suit the dress and the hairstyle. It’s a choice made by the wearer – some prefer tiaras, floral pieces, and diamanté slides. Choosing the perfect style for you: When choosing a style, you have to consider the shape of your face and ask yourself “do I have hair for it?’ Usually, kids come in with shoulder length hair and ask for long flowy curly hairstyles. Hairpieces can be used to enhance these styles. Fashion and style is more successful when you choose something that suits your personality as well as something that enhances your overall look. For example, an open-back dress draws a lot of attention, so an upstyle would be perfect for this type of dress. If you’re going for a fitted dress, a dramatic voluminous look would be great for balancing out the look. A ball gown is quite dramatic. A high sleek bun would look elegant. - POST
